WebWaka Production Readiness Audit

Context:
This repository is WebWaka, a large-scale Next.js (App Router) fullstack application using:
	•	Prisma + PostgreSQL (Supabase target)
	•	Next.js API routes (FastAPI proxy may exist but is optional)
	•	Multi-tenant, role-based platform with multiple suites (Education, Logistics, CRM, etc.)
	•	Intended deployment target: Vercel (production)
	•	Database target: Supabase (Postgres)
	•	Secrets managed via platform env vars (no .env committed)

⸻

🎯 Your Task

Perform a thorough, production-focused audit of this codebase and report everything required before a safe production deployment.

This is NOT a refactor task.
This is a review + gap analysis only.

⸻

🔍 Audit Scope (MANDATORY)

Please review and report on all of the following areas:

1️⃣ Build & Runtime Readiness
	•	Does yarn build / npm run build succeed?
	•	Any Next.js App Router misconfigurations?
	•	Any dev-only code paths (next dev, debug flags, console noise)?
	•	Any API routes or edge functions incompatible with Vercel?

2️⃣ Environment Variables & Secrets
	•	List ALL required environment variables (frontend + backend)
	•	Identify:
	•	Required vs optional
	•	Build-time vs runtime
	•	Confirm no secrets are hardcoded
	•	Flag missing or undocumented env vars

3️⃣ Database & Prisma
	•	Prisma schema validity
	•	Migration readiness (prisma migrate deploy)
	•	Any schema patterns unsafe for production?
	•	Connection pooling considerations for Vercel + Supabase
	•	Long-running queries or N+1 risks (high level)

4️⃣ Auth, Security & Multi-Tenancy
	•	Auth flow correctness (JWT/session handling)
	•	Tenant isolation risks
	•	Role/permission enforcement gaps
	•	API routes missing auth guards
	•	Any insecure defaults

5️⃣ Performance & Scalability
	•	Obvious bottlenecks in API routes
	•	Large server-side computations in request paths
	•	Missing caching opportunities
	•	Over-fetching in React components

6️⃣ Logging, Monitoring & Error Handling
	•	Are errors swallowed?
	•	Is logging production-safe?
	•	What is missing for observability (Sentry, logs, etc.)?

7️⃣ CI / Deployment Compatibility (Vercel)
	•	Anything that will break on Vercel specifically
	•	Edge vs Node compatibility issues
	•	File-system writes
	•	Background jobs assumptions

Review this like:

“Would I confidently deploy this to production for a paying customer?”

Be strict, realistic, and explicit.
