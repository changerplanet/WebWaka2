WEBWAKA — GOD-LEVEL PLATFORM GROUND TRUTH AUDIT (V2 – ZERO OMISSIONS)

⸻

🚨 NON-NEGOTIABLE PREMISE

You are NOT performing:
	•	A commerce audit
	•	A POS audit
	•	A UI audit
	•	A feature highlights report

You are performing a COMPLETE PLATFORM CENSUS.

This audit must enumerate and classify every single Suite, Module, Capability, Page, API, Service, Model, and UI surface in WebWaka — including those that are:
	•	Partially implemented
	•	Demo-only
	•	Backend-only
	•	UI-only
	•	Orphaned
	•	Disabled
	•	Unlinked
	•	Deprecated
	•	Hidden
	•	Incomplete
	•	Unreachable
	•	Unused

❗ Missing even one suite, module, or platform is a FAILURE.

⸻

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Produce a single source of truth document that answers, with certainty:

“What EXACTLY exists in WebWaka today, and what EXACTLY does not?”

This includes all industries, all suites, all roles, and all public/private surfaces.

⸻

🧠 MANDATORY MENTAL MODEL

You MUST assume nothing.

You MUST discover everything empirically by:
	•	File inspection
	•	Route enumeration
	•	Schema inspection
	•	Capability flags
	•	Navigation trees
	•	Demo seeds
	•	Feature toggles
	•	Hardcoded enums
	•	Folder structure
	•	Naming conventions

If something looks like it should exist, but does not — that is a finding.

⸻

🧱 STEP 1 — FULL SUITE & PLATFORM ENUMERATION (NO EXCEPTIONS)

You MUST generate a master list of ALL SUITES, including but not limited to:

Commerce & Operations
	•	POS
	•	SVM (Single Vendor Marketplace)
	•	MVM (Multi-Vendor Marketplace)
	•	ParkHub (Transport / Ticketing)
	•	Logistics
	•	Procurement
	•	Inventory
	•	Warehouse / Advanced Warehouse
	•	Accounting
	•	Billing
	•	Payments
	•	Subscriptions
	•	B2B Commerce

Industry Suites
	•	Education
	•	Health
	•	Hospitality
	•	Church
	•	Civic / Government
	•	Political
	•	Legal Practice
	•	Real Estate
	•	Recruitment
	•	Project Management
	•	Agriculture (if present)
	•	Manufacturing (if present)
	•	NGO / Non-Profit (if present)

Platform & Infrastructure
	•	Sites & Funnels
	•	Page Builder
	•	Funnel Builder
	•	Form Builder
	•	AI / Automation
	•	Analytics
	•	Compliance
	•	HR
	•	CRM
	•	Marketing
	•	Integrations
	•	Notifications (WhatsApp, SMS, Email)
	•	Identity & Access
	•	Partner Platform
	•	White-label / Branding
	•	Template System

⚠️ If a folder, schema, enum, capability flag, or route exists for something — it must appear in this list.

⸻

🧱 STEP 2 — FOR EACH SUITE, BUILD A FULL CAPABILITY MATRIX

For EVERY SINGLE SUITE, produce a table with NO SKIPPED COLUMNS:

Capability	Backend Logic Exists	API Exists	DB Models Exist	UI Exists	Publicly Accessible	Menu Linked	Demo Only	Role Access	Status


Status must be one of:
	•	✅ Fully End-to-End
	•	🟡 Partially Implemented
	•	🟠 Logic-Only
	•	🔴 Not Implemented
	•	🧪 Demo-Only

❗ If you are unsure, you must investigate until you are sure.

⸻

🧱 STEP 3 — ROLE-BASED ENTRY POINT AUDIT (ALL ROLES)

Enumerate every role that exists or is implied, including:
	•	Super Admin
	•	Partner
	•	Partner Staff
	•	Tenant Admin
	•	Tenant Staff
	•	Vendor (MVM)
	•	Vendor Staff
	•	POS Agent
	•	Park Agent
	•	Park Operator
	•	Driver
	•	Customer (Authenticated)
	•	Customer (Unauthenticated)
	•	Passenger
	•	Student
	•	Parent
	•	Patient
	•	Regulator
	•	Auditor

For EACH role:
	•	Login entry point
	•	Dashboard route
	•	Menu visibility
	•	What they can ACTUALLY do vs what logic exists
	•	Missing dashboards
	•	Missing menus
	•	Orphaned functionality

⸻

🧱 STEP 4 — PUBLIC SURFACE AUDIT (CRITICAL)

You MUST treat SVM, MVM, AND ParkHub equally as commerce platforms.

Explicitly audit:
	•	SVM Storefronts
	•	MVM Marketplaces
	•	ParkHub Operator Marketplaces
	•	Public vendor pages
	•	Public operator pages
	•	Public product pages
	•	Public route/schedule pages
	•	SEO exposure
	•	URL patterns
	•	Tenant slug routing
	•	Domain routing (if any)

If ParkHub does NOT have the same marketplace exposure rigor as SVM/MVM, that MUST be stated clearly.

⸻

🧱 STEP 5 — API VS UI USAGE CROSS-CHECK

For EVERY API group:
	•	Count routes
	•	Identify which are called by UI
	•	Identify orphaned APIs
	•	Identify demo-only APIs
	•	Identify APIs blocked by missing UI

No guessing allowed — verify imports and usage.

⸻

🧱 STEP 6 — DATA MODEL REALITY CHECK

For ALL Prisma models:
	•	Identify models actively used
	•	Models demo-seeded only
	•	Models never queried
	•	Models with no UI
	•	Models with no API
	•	Models representing unfinished features

⸻

🧱 STEP 7 — NAVIGATION & DISCOVERABILITY AUDIT

Explicitly list:
	•	Pages that exist but are not linked anywhere
	•	Expected pages that do not exist
	•	Dead routes
	•	Dev/test pages
	•	Demo pages

⸻

🧱 STEP 8 — STORE THE TRUTH IN ONE FINAL MATRIX

Produce a FINAL FEATURE TRUTH TABLE:

| Feature | Suite | Intended Purpose | Backend | API | UI | Public | Real Users Can Use | Safe to Ship | Notes |

No marketing language. Only facts.

⸻

🧾 REQUIRED OUTPUTS (MANDATORY)

1️⃣ Master Report

WEBWAKA_GROUND_TRUTH_AUDIT.md

2️⃣ Gap Inventory
	•	Grouped by Suite
	•	Grouped by Severity
	•	Explicitly states WHY each gap exists

3️⃣ No-Assumption Statement

At the end, you MUST include:

“I confirm that this audit was conducted via full codebase inspection, with no assumptions, and that every identifiable suite, module, and capability has been accounted for.”

⸻

🚫 ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
	•	❌ Skipping “minor” suites
	•	❌ Grouping unrelated features
	•	❌ Saying “out of scope”
	•	❌ Assuming intent
	•	❌ Inferring future plans
	•	❌ Collapsing ParkHub into MVM/SVM
	•	❌ Saying “likely”
	•	❌ Saying “appears to”

⸻

🛑 STOP CONDITION

Once the report is complete:
	•	STOP
	•	DO NOT suggest fixes
	•	DO NOT propose waves
	•	DO NOT prioritize
	•	DO NOT implement anything

This is observation only.

⸻

⚠️ FAILURE CONDITIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)

This execution is considered FAILED if:
	•	Any suite present in code is missing from the report
	•	ParkHub is not treated as a first-class marketplace
	•	Any role is ignored
	•	Any public surface is skipped
	•	Any assumption is made without evidence

⸻

🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

When complete, the leadership team must be able to say:

“This document tells us, with 100% certainty, what WebWaka truly is today.”
