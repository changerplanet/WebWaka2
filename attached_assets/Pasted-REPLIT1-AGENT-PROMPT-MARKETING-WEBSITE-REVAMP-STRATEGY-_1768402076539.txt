REPLIT1 AGENT PROMPT — MARKETING WEBSITE REVAMP (STRATEGY PHASE)

Context

You are working on WebWaka, a large multi-suite SaaS platform.
The frontend marketing website is now outdated and no longer reflects:
	•	The current number of suites
	•	The breadth of verticals
	•	The new Sites & Funnels capabilities
	•	The evolved partner-first business model
	•	The Nigerian/African market positioning

This task is NOT to implement or redesign the site yet.

Your job is to review, understand, and synthesize the current platform state and produce a clear, actionable plan to rebuild the marketing website from scratch.

⸻

🎯 PRIMARY GOAL

Produce a Marketing Website Revamp Plan that:
	•	Targets PARTNERS (resellers, agencies, operators) — NOT end-users
	•	Accurately represents ALL suites, including:
	•	Business verticals
	•	Sites & Funnels
	•	Commerce, Services, Community, and Government use cases
	•	Is mobile-first and Nigeria-first in:
	•	Content
	•	Language
	•	Navigation
	•	Examples
	•	Aligns with the current, real implementation (not assumptions)

⸻

🔍 REQUIRED REVIEW SCOPE (READ-ONLY)

You MUST thoroughly review and internalize:

1. Platform Documentation
	•	All docs under:
	•	frontend/docs/
	•	docs/templates/
	•	Demo seeding strategy documents
	•	Suite/module inventories
	•	Persona & role maps
	•	Sales demo walkthroughs

2. Implemented Suites & Capabilities

You must confirm and understand:
	•	All implemented suites (20+)
	•	What each suite actually does today
	•	How suites group into categories (Commerce, Services, Community, etc.)
	•	Cross-suite positioning for sales

3. Partner-First Model

Understand clearly:
	•	What a Partner is
	•	How Partners make money
	•	Why Partners care about:
	•	Vertical coverage
	•	Templates
	•	Funnels
	•	Multi-tenant management
	•	How WebWaka differs from “single-business software”

4. Sites & Funnels System

You must understand:
	•	Sites vs Funnels distinction
	•	Template-driven approach
	•	Industry-specific positioning
	•	Why this matters to Partners

⸻

🧭 KEY CONSTRAINTS (STRICT)

You must NOT:
	•	Modify any code
	•	Modify any content files
	•	Create UI components
	•	Touch schema, APIs, auth, or deployment
	•	Assume Replit1 output replaces Replit2 work

This is STRATEGY + PLANNING ONLY.

⸻

📦 REQUIRED DELIVERABLES

You must produce ALL of the following:

⸻

1️⃣ MARKETING WEBSITE INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE

A full sitemap for the new marketing site, including:
	•	Top-level navigation
	•	Sub-pages
	•	Grouping rationale

Example sections (you must validate and refine):
	•	Home
	•	Why WebWaka (Partner-focused)

	•	Partner Program
	•	Demo / How It Works

2️⃣ SUITE-TO-MARKETING MAPPING

For each suite, define:

	•	Partner value proposition
	•	Demo relevance (Strong / Medium / Mention-only)

This must include ALL suites, not a subset.

⸻

3️⃣ PARTNER-FOCUSED MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

Define:
	•	Core messaging pillars
	•	Key differentiators vs competitors
	•	Nigeria/Africa-specific positioning
	•	Language tone (professional, accessible, non-technical)

This is NOT copywriting yet, but strategic messaging guidance.

⸻

4️⃣ MOBILE-FIRST NAVIGATION STRATEGY

Design principles for:
	•	Mobile nav hierarchy
	•	Content prioritization for small screens
	•	Progressive disclosure
	•	WhatsApp-first CTAs where relevant

Nigeria-first considerations:
	•	Bandwidth sensitivity
	•	Business owner usage patterns
	•	Mobile-only partners

⸻

5️⃣ PAGE-LEVEL CONTENT PLAN (OUTLINE ONLY)

For each major page:
	•	Purpose
	•	Target partner persona
	•	Sections required
	•	Key questions it must answer

Do NOT write the final marketing copy yet.

	•	Phase M5: Funnel integration

🚦 STOP CONDITION

After delivering the plan:
	•	STOP
	•	Do NOT proceed to design or implementation
	•	Await explicit approval before any next phase

	•	Copywriters
	•	Developers
…without confusion
