🔓 AUTHORIZATION CONFIRMATION — WAVE F9

Status
	•	Waves F1–F8: ✅ Complete & Locked
	•	Wave F9: 🟢 Authorized
	•	Subsequent waves: 🔒 Locked until Wave F9 completion + approval

Scope (as previously defined)
Wave F9 delivers the advanced, platform-wide inventory sync engine that ensures reliable, Nigeria-first multi-channel commerce across:
	•	POS
	•	SVM
	•	MVM
	•	ParkHub (seat/capacity as inventory)

This wave builds on the Product Channel Configuration System, POS Offline Queue, and MVM Order Splitting already completed.

⸻

🎯 WAVE F9 OBJECTIVES (RECONFIRMED)
	1.	Real-Time (Event-Driven) Cross-Channel Sync
	•	POS ↔ SVM ↔ MVM stock updates
	•	ParkHub trip capacity treated as inventory
	•	No background cron jobs; event-triggered only
	2.	Conflict Detection & Resolution
	•	Offline-first conflict handling (oversell, stale price, channel-disabled)
	•	Severity-based outcomes with audit trails
	•	Manual resolution UI (no automation)
	3.	Inventory Modes Enforcement
	•	SHARED / ALLOCATED / UNLIMITED honored end-to-end
	•	Channel-specific allocations respected
	•	Clear reconciliation workflows
	4.	Stock Visibility & Traceability
	•	“What sold where” across channels
	•	Per-channel available vs reserved vs allocated views
	•	Historical movement logs
	5.	Nigeria-First Reliability
	•	Offline-safe queuing and replay
	•	Clear sync states and trust signals
	•	Mobile/PWA-friendly performance

🚧 EXECUTION PLAN (HIGH-LEVEL)

Phase F9.1 — Core Engine
	•	InventorySyncEngine (event-driven)
	•	Unified stock ledger
	•	Channel adapters (POS, SVM, MVM, ParkHub)

Phase F9.2 — Conflict & Resolution Layer
	•	Conflict classifier (mild/severe oversell, price mismatch, disabled channel)
	•	Manual resolution workflows
	•	Audit logs & receipts linkage

Phase F9.3 — Visibility APIs & UI Hooks
	•	Stock dashboards (admin-only)
	•	Traceability endpoints
	•	Low-stock + reconciliation views (no automation)

Phase F9.4 — Offline Replay & Integrity
	•	Deterministic replay from offline queues
	•	Idempotent event handling
	•	Sync status propagation to UI components

⸻

🛑 GOVERNANCE & CONSTRAINTS (STILL IN FORCE)
	•	❌ No automation or cron jobs
	•	❌ No background workers
	•	❌ No auto-reordering
	•	❌ No schema changes outside inventory domain
	•	❌ No cross-tenant data access
	•	✅ Manual, user-triggered reconciliation only
	•	✅ Demo-safe operation maintained

📦 REQUIRED DELIVERABLES (AT STOP)

At completion, I will provide a Wave F9 Completion Report including:
	1.	Services & APIs created
	2.	Data models added/extended
	3.	Conflict types & resolution flows
	4.	Offline vs online behavior
	5.	POS/SVM/MVM/ParkHub integration points
	6.	Explicit confirmations of constraints
	7.	Next-wave recommendations

I will STOP after the report and wait for your approval before any further work.

Proceeding now with Wave F9 — Inventory Sync Engine (Advanced).
