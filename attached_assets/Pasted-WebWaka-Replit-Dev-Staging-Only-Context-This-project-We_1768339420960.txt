WebWaka (Replit = Dev/Staging Only)

Context

This project (WebWaka) is a Next.js 14 full-stack application using Prisma + PostgreSQL.
Replit is NOT production. Replit is used only for development and staging validation.
Production deployment will happen on Vercel.

Your task is to stabilize and verify the Replit development deployment only, without introducing production-specific changes.

⸻

🎯 Your Mission (Strict Scope)

Perform only the steps below, in order.
Do not go beyond them unless explicitly instructed.

⸻

STEP 1 — Verify Replit Dev Environment Configuration (READ-ONLY unless broken)
	1.	Confirm the following Replit deployment/run configuration:
	•	Root directory: frontend
	•	Install command: npm install
	•	Build command: npm run build
	•	Run command (dev/staging):

npm run dev -- -p 5000 -H 0.0.0.0


	2.	Verify that:
	•	No npm --prefix commands are used
	•	No hardcoded ports exist in source code
	•	No .env files are committed

📌 Do not modify scripts unless they are incorrect.

⸻

STEP 2 — Verify Required Replit Secrets (READ-ONLY)

Confirm that the following secrets exist in Replit Secrets:

NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=***
DIRECT_URL=***
JWT_SECRET=***
SESSION_SECRET=***
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=***
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://<replit-app>.replit.app

	•	Do NOT generate secrets
	•	Do NOT change values
	•	Only report missing ones

⸻

STEP 3 — Validate Dev Runtime Behavior

Run and verify:
	•	npm run dev starts successfully
	•	App is accessible on port 5000
	•	Homepage returns HTTP 200
	•	/api/health returns HTTP 200
	•	Prisma connects successfully
	•	No runtime crashes

📌 This is development runtime only, not production build optimization.

⸻

STEP 4 — Identify Replit-Specific Deployment Blockers

If deployment fails on Replit Publishing:
	1.	Identify only Replit-specific blockers, such as:
	•	Memory limits
	•	Publishing mode incompatibilities
	•	Static pre-render issues unique to Replit
	•	Next.js features unsupported by Replit Publishing
	2.	Do NOT:
	•	Refactor architecture
	•	Optimize for Vercel
	•	Change caching strategies
	•	Modify Prisma schema
	•	Introduce production-only flags

⸻

STEP 5 — Apply ONLY Low-Risk, Dev-Only Fixes (If Needed)

You may apply fixes only if ALL conditions are met:
	•	Fix is Replit-only
	•	Fix does not affect production
	•	Fix does not change business logic
	•	Fix does not change database schema
	•	Fix is reversible

Examples of allowed fixes:
	•	Guarding undefined env vars in dev UI
	•	Disabling dev-only pages when secrets missing
	•	Adjusting dev build commands
	•	Adding conditional rendering for demo routes

🚫 Disallowed:
	•	Removing features
	•	Changing auth flows
	•	Changing tenant logic
	•	Adding production flags
	•	Changing Prisma models

⸻

STEP 6 — Produce a Final Replit Readiness Report

When finished, output a structured report with:

✅ VERIFIED
	•	Dev server status
	•	Prisma connectivity
	•	API health
	•	Secrets presence

❌ BLOCKERS (if any)
	•	Exact error
	•	File + line
	•	Why it blocks Replit
	•	Whether it affects Vercel (Yes / No)

🔧 FIXES APPLIED (if any)
	•	Files modified
	•	Exact diffs
	•	Justification

🚦 FINAL VERDICT

One of:
	•	READY for Replit Dev/Staging
	•	BLOCKED on Replit only
	•	BLOCKED globally (affects Vercel too)

⸻

⛔ Hard Rules
	•	Do NOT optimize for production
	•	Do NOT touch Vercel config
	•	Do NOT introduce new dependencies
	•	Do NOT change database behavior
	•	Do NOT continue past this scope

Stop after the report.
