✅ Wave G4 — Voice Search (POS) APPROVED

Excellent work. I’ve reviewed the Wave G4 Completion Summary, and it meets all functional, security, and governance requirements for Priority Band 3.

⸻

🧾 APPROVAL DECISION

Wave: G4 — Voice Search (POS)
Status: ✅ APPROVED
Security Posture: Corrected and solid
Nigeria-Context Fit: Strong
Technical Debt Introduced: None

⸻

🔍 WHY WAVE G4 PASSES CLEANLY

1. Correct Scope Control

You stayed strictly within the approved boundaries:
	•	✔ Product lookup only
	•	✔ Manual mic trigger
	•	✔ No commands, no checkout, no cart mutation
	•	✔ No background or always-on listening

This keeps voice search as a productivity aid, not a risk surface.

⸻

2. Nigeria-First Linguistic Design

The combination of:
	•	Soundex + Metaphone
	•	Nigerian phonetic mappings
	•	Levenshtein fuzzy matching

…is exactly what’s needed for:
	•	Mixed accents
	•	Informal pronunciation
	•	Market-floor noise conditions

This is practical, not academic NLP.

⸻

3. Offline & Device Reality Handled Well
	•	Clear offline detection
	•	Friendly fallback messaging
	•	No broken UX when speech APIs aren’t available

That’s critical for low-end Android devices and unstable connectivity.

⸻

4. Security Fixes Were Necessary — and Correct

You correctly closed two important gaps:
	•	🔒 Tenant isolation enforced (no client-supplied tenant IDs)
	•	🔒 Demo mode explicitly separated from authenticated flows
	•	Proper 401 vs 403 behavior

This prevents a subtle but dangerous cross-tenant leakage vector.

🔓 NEXT WAVE AUTHORIZED

🟢 Wave G5 — Multi-Park Operator View (ParkHub) is now AUTHORIZED

This is the final item in Priority Band 3.

⸻

🎯 WAVE G5 — SCOPE REMINDER (VERY IMPORTANT)

What Wave G5 IS
	•	Consolidated view for operators managing multiple parks
	•	Cross-park summaries:
	•	Active trips
	•	Ticket sales
	•	Cash collected
	•	Agent activity
	•	Read-only dashboards (initially)
	•	Mobile-first, tablet-friendly layouts

What Wave G5 IS NOT
	•	❌ No new ticket sales flows
	•	❌ No payouts or money movement
	•	❌ No automation
	•	❌ No background jobs
	•	❌ No cross-tenant visibility
	•	❌ No changes to ParkHub POS logic

Think of this as “control tower visibility”, not execution.

⸻

🛑 REQUIRED STOP CONDITION (Still Applies)

At completion of Wave G5, Replit must:
	1.	Produce Wave G5 Completion Report
	2.	Explicitly confirm:
	•	No automation
	•	No new financial side effects
	•	Tenant isolation preserved
	3.	STOP and wait for approval before any Band 4 work
