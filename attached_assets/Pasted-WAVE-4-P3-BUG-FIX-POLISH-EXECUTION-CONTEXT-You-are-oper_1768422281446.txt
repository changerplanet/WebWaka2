CONTEXT

You are operating on the WebWaka platform codebase.
Waves 1–3 of the comprehensive bug hunt have been fully completed, fixed, and verified.

This prompt authorizes Wave 4 ONLY — covering Low Priority (P3) polish items identified in the Post-Phase Z Bug Hunt Report.

This is the final polish wave before Vercel deployment.

⸻

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Improve perceived quality, UX polish, SEO hygiene, and demo cleanliness without introducing new features, changing business logic, or touching core systems.

Wave 4 items are non-blocking, but must be implemented cleanly and conservatively.

⸻

You MUST:
	•	❌ NOT modify Prisma schema
	•	❌ NOT modify database data or seed scripts

🧩 WAVE 4 SCOPE (P3 ONLY)

1️⃣ Navigation & UX Polish
	•	Add breadcrumb navigation to:
	•	Suite admin pages
	•	Deep dashboard pages
	•	Breadcrumbs must:
	•	Be mobile-friendly
	•	Collapse gracefully on small screens
	•	Never break existing navigation

⸻

2️⃣ Loading Experience Improvements
	•	Replace generic spinners with skeleton loaders where feasible:
	•	Dashboards
	•	Lists (students, patients, products, tenants)
	•	Skeletons must:
	•	Match layout shape
	•	Respect mobile-first design
	•	Fail back to spinner if data errors

⸻

3️⃣ robots.txt & SEO Hygiene
	•	Implement an optimized robots.txt:
	•	Allow indexing of marketing pages
	•	Disallow admin, dashboard, API routes
	•	Do NOT affect sitemap logic unless already present

⸻

4️⃣ UI Consistency Cleanup
	•	Normalize form placeholders:
	•	Emails → you@example.com
	•	Phone → +234 913 500 3000
	•	Apply consistently across marketing + app forms

⸻

5️⃣ Demo / Production Boundary Cleanup
	•	Hide demo-only UI elements in production builds:
	•	“View Test OTPs”
	•	Any explicit demo helper buttons
	•	Use environment-based guards (process.env.NODE_ENV)
	•	Demo behavior must still work in development

⸻

6️⃣ Console & Developer Noise Reduction
	•	Reduce remaining console warnings / logs that:
	•	Add no diagnostic value
	•	Are not errors
	•	DO NOT remove meaningful error logs

⸻

🛑 EXECUTION RULES
	•	Treat Wave 4 as a single execution group
	•	Implement all P3 items together
	•	When finished:
	•	STOP immediately
	•	Produce a Wave 4 Completion Report
	•	List:
	•	Files modified
	•	Before/after behavior
	•	Verification steps
	•	Confirmation no restricted areas were touched

DO NOT:
	•	Proceed to deployment
	•	Start Vercel setup
	•	Touch enhancements backlog
	•	Fix anything outside P3 scope

⸻

📄 REQUIRED OUTPUT

At completion, produce:

Wave 4 Final Report
	•	Status: COMPLETE / PARTIAL
	•	Bugs addressed (BUG-026 → BUG-032)
	•	UX before vs after summary
	•	SEO & polish checklist
	•	Confirmation of safety constraints
	•	Explicit STOP notice

⸻

🚨 IMPORTANT

This wave is about polish, not power.
If any change risks destabilizing the system, SKIP it and document why.
