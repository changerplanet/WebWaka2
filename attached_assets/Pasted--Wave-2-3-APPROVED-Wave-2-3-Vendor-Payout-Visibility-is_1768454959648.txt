✅ Wave 2.3 — APPROVED

Wave 2.3 (Vendor Payout Visibility) is formally accepted.

⸻

✅ Approval Rationale

Wave 2.3 meets all architectural, security, and governance constraints exactly as intended.

🔐 Authorization & Security (Critical)
	•	✅ Vendor isolation is correct
Vendor APIs now resolve vendorId strictly from the authenticated session via mvm_vendor_staff.
➜ Vendors cannot spoof or query other vendors’ data.
	•	✅ Partner data properly protected
Partner-level analytics are restricted to TENANT_ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN only.
	•	✅ Least-privilege enforced by default
Vendors are auto-scoped without needing to pass identifiers (eliminates attack surface).

This closes a major multi-tenant risk class cleanly.

⸻

📊 Functional Coverage (Visibility Without Automation)

Wave 2.3 delivers exactly what this phase is meant to unlock: trust through transparency, without financial risk.
