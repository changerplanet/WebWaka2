Approved ✅ — Proceed with Wave 3 (P2 Medium-Priority Bugs)

Great work on Wave 2. The fixes and scope discipline look solid.

You are now authorized to proceed with Wave 3, covering P2 (Medium Priority) bugs, with the same controlled execution model.

✅ Authorized Scope — Wave 3 (P2)

Fix only the following P2 issues (as previously identified). Group them logically, but do not expand scope.

UX / Routing / Consistency
	1.	BUG-014 — Sample/Demo data references in production pages
	•	Remove or clearly label as demo-only
	•	Ensure real seeded data is used where available
	2.	BUG-015 — Missing suite landing pages
	•	Add minimal index page.tsx where suites exist but have only subroutes
	•	Or add safe redirects to the correct admin/dashboard pages
	3.	BUG-016 — Inconsistent route naming
	•	Standardize where feasible (e.g. /education vs /edu)
	•	Add backward-compatible redirects where renaming is not safe
	4.	BUG-018 — Missing canonical login redirect
	•	Ensure deprecated login URLs redirect cleanly to the canonical login

⸻

UX Robustness
	5.	BUG-017 — return null without fallback UI
	•	Replace with explicit loading, empty, or error states where appropriate
	6.	BUG-019 — Infinite spinners on suite admin pages
	•	Add timeout + error state (non-blocking UX fix)
	7.	BUG-020 — Generic page titles
	•	Update to descriptive, SEO-friendly titles for suite pages

⸻

Developer / Platform Clarity
	8.	BUG-021 — tenantId requirement not clear in APIs
	•	Improve error messages or inline documentation (no breaking changes)
	9.	BUG-022 — Missing error boundaries
	•	Add lightweight error boundaries at layout or page-group level
	10.	BUG-023 — Duplicate PWA service worker logs

	•	Ensure single registration

	11.	BUG-025 — DemoIndicator not visible

	•	Verify rendering and visibility conditions

⸻

🚫 Explicitly Out of Scope (Still)
	•	New features
	•	Schema changes
	•	Data reseeding
	•	Performance refactors
	•	P3 polish items (breadcrumbs, skeleton loaders, robots.txt, etc.)
	•	Deployment

⸻

📄 Required Output (After Wave 3)

Produce:
frontend/docs/PHASE_BUGFIX_WAVE_3_REPORT.md

Include:
	•	BUG-ID → fix mapping
	•	Files modified
	•	UX before/after notes (brief)
	•	Verification checklist
	•	Confirmation of no scope creep

Then:
🛑 STOP and wait for approval before Wave 4 (P3 / polish)

You’re cleared to proceed.
