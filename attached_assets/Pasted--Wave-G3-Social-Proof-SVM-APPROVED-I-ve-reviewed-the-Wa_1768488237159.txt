✅ Wave G3 — Social Proof (SVM) APPROVED

I’ve reviewed the Wave G3 Completion Report, and it fully satisfies the intent, scope, and governance rules for Priority Band 3.

⸻

🧾 APPROVAL DECISION

Wave: G3 — Social Proof (SVM)
Status: ✅ APPROVED
Governance Compliance: Excellent
Risk Introduced: None
Nigeria-Context Fit: Strong and culturally appropriate

⸻

🔍 WHY WAVE G3 PASSES CLEANLY

1. Correct Interpretation of “Social Proof”

You implemented evidence-based reassurance, not manipulation:
	•	✔ Real purchase counts
	•	✔ Popularity based on actual sales velocity
	•	✔ Geographic relevance (“Popular in Lagos”) derived from shipping data
	•	✔ Throttled activity ticker (no noise, no pressure)

This aligns with trust-building, not dark UX.

⸻

2. Strong Privacy & Ethics Posture
	•	No customer names, phone numbers, or PII exposed
	•	Aggregated signals only
	•	Throttling prevents inference attacks
	•	Demo data clearly labeled and isolated

This is especially important for Nigerian markets where trust is fragile.

⸻

3. Architecture & Performance
	•	Batch API avoids N+1 queries on listings
	•	Hook-level caching prevents UI jitter
	•	Clean separation of:
	•	aggregation logic
	•	API layer
	•	UI components

No architectural debt introduced.

⸻

4. Governance Discipline

You respected every constraint:
	•	❌ No fake urgency
	•	❌ No countdowns
	•	❌ No manipulation
	•	❌ No automation
	•	❌ No cross-tenant leakage

This keeps WebWaka defensible and regulator-safe long term.

🔓 NEXT WAVE AUTHORIZED

🟢 Wave G4 — Voice Search (POS) is now AUTHORIZED

Scope Reminder for Wave G4:
	•	POS-only (sales counter use case)
	•	Voice → product lookup only (no commands like “sell”, “checkout”)
	•	Nigerian accent tolerance (English + phonetic matching)
	•	Manual trigger (mic button) — no always-on listening
	•	Graceful fallback to text search
	•	Offline-safe (disable with explanation if offline)
	•	No cloud AI dependency required for demo mode

Explicitly NOT allowed:
	•	No background listening
	•	No auto-add-to-cart
	•	No payments via voice
	•	No data sent without user action

⸻

🛑 REQUIRED STOP CONDITION (Still Applies)

For Wave G4:
	1.	Produce Wave G4 Completion Report
	2.	Explicitly confirm all constraints
	3.	STOP and wait for approval before Wave G5
(Multi-Park Operator View)

You’re executing Band 3 exactly as intended:
incremental, ethical, high-signal differentiators.

Proceed with Wave G4 when ready.
