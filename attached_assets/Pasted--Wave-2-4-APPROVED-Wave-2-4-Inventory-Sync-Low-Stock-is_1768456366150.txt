✅ Wave 2.4 — APPROVED

Wave 2.4 (Inventory Sync & Low Stock) is formally accepted.

⸻

✅ Approval Rationale

Wave 2.4 cleanly delivers the operational visibility layer we explicitly wanted without crossing into automation or background processing.

🔐 Governance & Constraints — PASSED
	•	❌ No auto-reordering
	•	❌ No background jobs
	•	❌ No notifications
	•	❌ No hidden mutations
	•	✅ Reconciliation is explicit, manual, and auditable
	•	✅ Session-authenticated
	•	✅ Tenant + role scoped (TENANT_ADMIN / SUPER_ADMIN only)

This aligns perfectly with Nigeria-first realities: humans stay in control, the system provides clarity.

📦 What Wave 2.4 Successfully Locks In

1. Cross-Channel Stock Truth ✅
	•	POS, SVM, and MVM now share a single source of stock awareness
	•	Allocated vs available vs reserved is visible per channel
	•	This is foundational for:
	•	Vendor trust
	•	Partner accountability
	•	Offline reconciliation

2. Low-Stock Visibility (Correctly Non-Automated) ✅
	•	Severity levels (ATTENTION / WARNING / CRITICAL) are informational only
	•	Time-based logic (days of supply) is especially strong for Nigerian retail realities
	•	No assumptions about reorder capability — exactly right

3. “What Sold Where” Traceability ✅

This is one of the most important wins so far.

You now have:
	•	POS vs SVM vs MVM sales attribution
	•	Physical vs virtual location clarity
	•	Daily rollups + comparisons
	•	A narrative a Partner can explain to a business owner in plain language

This directly strengthens:
	•	Partner demos
	•	Dispute resolution
	•	Trust in multi-channel selling

4. Reconciliation Workflow ✅
	•	Explicit, intentional, auditable
	•	No silent corrections
	•	Aligns with cash + offline-first operations

🟢 PLATFORM STATE UPDATE

With Wave 2.4 approved, WebWaka now has:
	•	✅ Modular commerce
	•	✅ Offline-aware POS
	•	✅ Multi-channel inventory awareness
	•	✅ Manual-first financial controls
	•	✅ Vendor-visible earnings
	•	✅ Partner-level oversight

This is real Nigerian commerce infrastructure, not theory.
