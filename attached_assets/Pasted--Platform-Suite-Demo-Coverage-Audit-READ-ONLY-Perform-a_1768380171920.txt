Platform Suite & Demo Coverage Audit (READ-ONLY)

Perform a comprehensive, read-only platform audit to establish a single source of truth for:
	1.	All suites in the platform
	2.	All modules under each suite
	3.	Demo Partner coverage for each module
	4.	Demo data completeness per role and activity

This audit must NOT modify code, database, schema, or configuration.

⸻

🔒 Scope Rules (STRICT)
	•	❌ Do NOT create, modify, or delete any data
	•	❌ Do NOT run seed scripts
	•	❌ Do NOT deploy or rebuild
	•	❌ Do NOT change permissions or roles
	•	❌ Do NOT fix issues
	•	✅ Read-only inspection only
	•	✅ Database queries allowed (SELECT only)
	•	✅ Static code analysis allowed

🎯 Objectives

1️⃣ Identify All Suites in the Platform

Confirm every suite that exists, including but not limited to:
	•	Commerce
	•	Sites & Funnels
	•	Logistics
	•	Hospitality
	•	Civic
	•	Health
	•	Education
	•	Real Estate
	•	Recruitment
	•	Project Management
	•	Church
	•	Political

📌 If additional suites exist, they must be included.

⸻

2️⃣ Identify All Modules Under Each Suite

For each suite, produce:
	•	Module name
	•	Path(s) in codebase
	•	Primary database entities (tables/models)
	•	Primary API routes
	•	UI entry points (dashboard paths)

📄 Output format (example):

Suite: Education
- Student Management
- Curriculum
- Assessments
- Attendance
- Billing


⸻

3️⃣ Demo Partner Assignment Audit

For each suite and module, determine:
	•	Is the module assigned to the Demo Partner?
	•	Is it visible in the partner dashboard navigation?
	•	Is access role-gated correctly?

For each module, report:

Suite	Module	Assigned to Demo Partner	Visible in UI	Notes



⸻

4️⃣ Demo Data Coverage Audit (CRITICAL)

For each module, verify whether demo data exists for:
	•	Partner Owner
	•	Partner Admin
	•	Partner Staff / Lowest-privilege role

Check for:
	•	Core entities (records exist)
	•	Sample transactions / activities
	•	Historical data (where applicable)

⚠️ If no data exists, explicitly mark as NOT SEEDED.

Example:

Suite	Module	Demo Data Exists	Roles Covered	Data Types Missing



⸻

5️⃣ Demo Seed Script Coverage Mapping

Cross-reference findings with existing seed scripts:
	•	Identify which suites/modules are covered by:
	•	seed-demo-partner-master.ts
	•	Any other seed scripts
	•	Identify gaps where:
	•	Module exists
	•	UI exists
	•	API exists
	•	❌ No seed logic exists

⸻

📦 Deliverables (MANDATORY)

Produce the following files under /frontend/docs/:
	1.	PLATFORM_SUITE_MODULE_INVENTORY.md
	•	Full suite → module hierarchy
	2.	DEMO_PARTNER_ASSIGNMENT_MATRIX.md
	•	Which modules are assigned/visible to Demo Partner
	3.	DEMO_DATA_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md
	•	Which modules have demo data per role
	4.	DEMO_GAP_SUMMARY.md
	•	Clear list of:
	•	Missing demo data
	•	Missing module assignments
	•	Missing seed coverage

⸻

🚦 Final Output Requirements

At the end of the report, include:

✅ Confirmed
	•	List of suites fully demo-ready

⚠️ Partial
	•	Suites with some modules missing demo data

❌ Blocked
	•	Suites/modules that cannot be demo-tested

🔑 Recommendation
	•	Whether the platform is ready for:
	•	Partial demo testing
	•	Full partner demo
	•	Public demo
	•	What must be seeded or assigned before holistic testing

⸻

🛑 Stop Condition

After producing the reports:
	•	❌ Do NOT implement fixes
	•	❌ Do NOT seed data
	•	❌ Do NOT deploy

Stop after reporting.
