🔴 WAVE I.1 — SVM PUBLIC STOREFRONT ROUTING
⸻

CONTEXT

WebWaka already has a fully implemented Single Vendor Marketplace (SVM) backend and UI components (product grid, product detail, cart, checkout, offline cart, social proof).

However, the storefront is not publicly exposed due to missing tenant-based routing.

This task is to expose what already exists, not to build new commerce logic.

⸻

OBJECTIVE

Implement public, SEO-safe, tenant-based storefront routing so each tenant has a real online store.

⸻

SCOPE — MUST IMPLEMENT

1. Public Storefront Routing

Create public routes:
	•	/[tenantSlug]/store
	•	/[tenantSlug]/product/[productSlug]

Tenant resolution must be server-side and must:
	•	Resolve tenant by tenantSlug
	•	Fail safely with a “Store Not Available” page if:
	•	Tenant does not exist
	•	Store capability is disabled
	•	Tenant is suspended

⸻

2. Use Existing Components ONLY

You must reuse existing components:
	•	ProductGrid
	•	ProductDetail
	•	CartDrawer / MiniCart
	•	CheckoutPage
	•	OfflineCartIndicator
	•	SocialProofBadge / RecentPurchasesTicker

❌ Do NOT create new product, cart, or checkout logic
❌ Do NOT modify pricing, inventory, or payment logic

⸻

3. Tenant Isolation & Security
	•	All API calls must resolve tenant context from tenantSlug
	•	No tenantId passed from client
	•	No cross-tenant leakage
	•	Demo tenants remain accessible as-is

⸻

4. SEO & UX Requirements
	•	Proper <title> and meta tags per tenant
	•	Canonical URLs
	•	Clean 404 for invalid tenant/product
	•	Mobile-first layouts preserved

⸻

5. Explicit Non-Goals (DO NOT DO)
	•	❌ No marketplace logic
	•	❌ No vendor features
	•	❌ No new schemas
	•	❌ No automation
	•	❌ No background jobs

⸻

DELIVERABLES

At completion, you must produce:
	1.	List of new routes created
	2.	Tenant resolution strategy used
	3.	Screenshots or route confirmation for:
	•	Valid tenant storefront
	•	Invalid tenant fallback
	4.	Confirmation that checkout, offline cart, and social proof still work
	5.	Explicit confirmation of NO new business logic

⸻

STOP CONDITION

After completing Wave I.1:
	•	STOP
	•	Do NOT proceed to Wave I.2
	•	Await explicit approval

	•	Vendor registration
	•	Product channel config
	•	Order splitting
	•	Commissions
	•	Payout logic

	•	Vendor profile pages
	•	Product listings across vendors
	•	Vendor trust badges & ratings (reuse existing)

	•	Marketplace checkout UI

⸻

3. Use Existing Logic ONLY

You must reuse:
	•	Order splitting engine
	•	Vendor rating system
	•	Commission logic
	•	ProductChannelConfig
	•	Existing checkout/payment services

❌ No new marketplace logic
❌ No new payout logic
❌ No new schemas

⸻

4. Isolation & Safety

	•	Vendors only visible within their tenant
	•	Demo vendors clearly labeled

⸻

5. Explicit Non-Goals
	•	❌ No vendor onboarding changes
	•	❌ No promotions

⸻

CONTEXT

ParkHub already supports:
	•	Public booking

⸻

OBJECTIVE

⸻

SCOPE — MUST IMPLEMENT

1. Public ParkHub Marketplace Routes

Create:

	•	Operator/company listings
	•	Operator profile pages
	•	Routes & schedules per operator
	•	Entry into existing booking flow
	•	Display ratings/trust where applicable

⸻

3. Use Existing Systems

	•	park_trip
	•	park_ticket
	•	Booking flow
	•	Receipt & manifest verification

❌ No new trip logic
❌ No pricing changes
❌ No automation

⸻

4. Constraints
	•	Read-only public browsing
	•	Booking still happens via existing flow
	•	Demo operators clearly marked

⸻

DELIVERABLES

At completion:
	1.	List of new public routes
	2.	Operator listing screenshots
	3.	Route browser confirmation
	4.	Booking handoff confirmation
	5.	Explicit confirmation NO operational logic changed

⸻

STOP CONDITION

After Wave I.3:
	•	STOP COMPLETELY
	•	Await next phase authorization

⸻

✅ FINAL NOTE FOR REPLIT

These waves are exposure waves, not feature waves.

If any task requires new core logic, schemas, or automation — STOP and report immediately.
