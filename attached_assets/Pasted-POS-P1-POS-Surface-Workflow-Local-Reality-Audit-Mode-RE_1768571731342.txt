POS-P1 — POS Surface, Workflow & Local Reality Audit

Mode: READ-ONLY ANALYSIS
Fixes: ❌ FORBIDDEN
Schema Changes: ❌ FORBIDDEN
Assumptions: ❌ FORBIDDEN
Outcome: AUDIT REPORT ONLY
Hard Stop: REQUIRED

⸻

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Conduct a full, no-assumption, read-only audit of the Point of Sale (POS) suite in WebWaka, covering:
	1.	Surface completeness
	2.	Workflow correctness
	3.	UI ↔ backend parity
	4.	Nigeria-first, Mobile-first, Offline-first, PWA-first fitness

This audit must reveal what actually exists, what is missing, and what breaks under real Nigerian operating conditions.

⸻

🧱 SCOPE (MANDATORY — NOTHING MAY BE SKIPPED)

A. POS SURFACE CENSUS (GROUND TRUTH)

Enumerate every POS surface across all roles:

1. UI SURFACES
	•	POS dashboard(s)
	•	Sales screen(s)
	•	Cart / line-item editor
	•	Payment capture screens
	•	Receipt screens (print / WhatsApp / view)
	•	Refund / void / cancel flows
	•	Offline indicators & sync states
	•	Error / recovery screens

For each screen:
	•	Route
	•	Role access
	•	Desktop vs mobile availability
	•	Demo vs live behavior
	•	Whether it is reachable via navigation or orphaned

❌ Do NOT infer missing screens
❌ Only list what exists in code

⸻

B. POS WORKFLOW AUDIT (END-TO-END)

Trace real cashier workflows step by step:
	1.	Start sale
	2.	Add items
	3.	Modify quantities
	4.	Apply discounts / rounding
	5.	Select payment method:
	•	Cash
	•	Transfer
	•	Card
	•	Mixed
	6.	Finalize sale
	7.	Issue receipt
	8.	Sync (if offline)
	9.	Error recovery

For each step:
	•	UI present? (Yes/No)
	•	Backend logic present? (Yes/No)
	•	Can the step be completed on mobile only?
	•	Can the step be completed offline?
	•	What breaks if network drops?

⸻

C. ROLE & PERMISSION REALITY CHECK

Audit POS behavior for:
	•	Cashier
	•	Supervisor
	•	Manager
	•	Admin

Identify:
	•	What each role can do
	•	What they should do but cannot
	•	Any privilege leaks or unsafe assumptions

⸻

D. OFFLINE-FIRST TRUTH AUDIT (CRITICAL)

Answer explicitly (no theory):
	•	What POS actions work fully offline?
	•	What is queued?
	•	What is blocked?
	•	Where conflicts occur on sync
	•	Whether conflict resolution is:
	•	deterministic
	•	explainable to staff
	•	recoverable without admin

Include:
	•	IndexedDB usage
	•	Sync triggers
	•	Failure modes
	•	Data loss risks

⸻

E. NIGERIA-FIRST REALITY AUDIT (MANDATORY)

Audit POS against actual Nigerian merchant behavior:
	•	Cash-heavy flows
	•	Bank transfer reference capture
	•	Partial / delayed payments
	•	Power loss mid-transaction
	•	Shared devices
	•	Agent trust models

Identify:
	•	What Nigerian merchants do today outside software
	•	Which of those behaviors are not modeled in POS

❌ No “should have” features
✅ Only documented gaps vs reality

⸻

F. MOBILE-FIRST FITNESS

Evaluate POS on:
	•	Low-end Android devices
	•	Small screens
	•	Touch accuracy
	•	Typing burden
	•	Performance under poor memory

Flag:
	•	Any flow that assumes keyboard/mouse
	•	Any screen unusable on mobile

⸻

G. PWA-FIRST CHECKLIST

Document:
	•	Installability
	•	Offline launch behavior
	•	Background sync
	•	Update strategy
	•	Storage limits & failure behavior

⸻

📦 REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

Create a single report:

POS_P1_AUDIT_REPORT.md

With the following sections in order:
	1.	POS Surface Inventory (table)
	2.	POS Workflow Trace (step-by-step)
	3.	Role & Permission Findings
	4.	Offline-First Reality Findings
	5.	Nigeria-First Gap Inventory
	•	Tag each gap as: NX-#, MF-#, OF-#, PWA-#
	6.	Mobile-First UX Gaps
	7.	PWA-First Gaps
	8.	Confirmed Invariants (things that work and must not be broken)
	9.	Explicit Gap List (with severity + future wave owner)
	10.	No-Assumption Confirmation Statement

⸻

🛑 STRICT STOP CONDITIONS

You MUST STOP when:
	•	The report is complete
	•	No fixes have been applied
	•	No code has been changed
	•	No schemas have been touched

End with:

“POS-P1 COMPLETE — STOP FOR HUMAN VERIFICATION”

You are NOT ALLOWED to:
	•	Propose fixes
	•	Begin remediation
	•	Start POS-P2
	•	Refactor anything

⸻

⚠️ ENFORCEMENT RULES
	•	If something is unclear → document ambiguity, do NOT resolve it
	•	If a feature seems missing → confirm absence in code before listing
	•	If behavior differs between demo/live → document both
	•	If offline behavior is partial → document exactly where it breaks

⸻

✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

After POS-P1, we must be able to say with certainty:

“We know exactly how POS behaves today — in Nigeria, on mobile, offline, and under stress.”
