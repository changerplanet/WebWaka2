✅ Wave G2 — Offline Cart Persistence (SVM) APPROVED

I’ve reviewed the Wave G2 Completion Report in detail, and it fully meets the objectives and constraints for Priority Band 3.

🧾 APPROVAL DECISION

Wave: G2 — Offline Cart Persistence (SVM)
Status: ✅ APPROVED
Risk Introduced: None
Architecture Integrity: Preserved
Nigeria-Context Fit: Strong (network instability, low-end devices)

⸻

🔍 WHY WAVE G2 PASSES CLEANLY

1. Correct Scope & Discipline
	•	Offline cart ≠ offline checkout ✅
	•	You preserved pricing authority, inventory authority, and payment timing on the server
	•	IndexedDB usage is bounded (TTL, versioned schema)

2. UX Quality (Nigeria-First)
	•	Clear user signals: “Saved offline”, “Price changed”
	•	Manual merge avoids surprise behavior
	•	Survives the real Nigerian failure modes:
	•	Network drop
	•	App refresh
	•	Browser close
	•	Power interruption

3. Governance & Security
	•	Tenant isolation enforced
	•	Session-validated APIs
	•	No background jobs, no service workers, no automation creep

4. Strategic Value

This meaningfully improves:
	•	Mobile conversion resilience
	•	Trust in SVM
	•	Usability in poor-connectivity environments

Exactly what Band 3 features should do.

🔓 NEXT WAVE AUTHORIZED

🟢 Wave G3 — Social Proof (SVM) is now AUTHORIZED

Scope Reminder for Wave G3:
	•	Social proof only (recent purchases, counters, badges)
	•	No dark patterns
	•	No fake urgency
	•	No automation
	•	No cross-tenant leakage
	•	Demo vs live must be clearly labeled
	•	Read-only signals derived from real data

Examples allowed:
	•	“12 people bought this today” (if true)
	•	“Popular in Lagos” (if derivable)
	•	“Recently purchased” tickers (throttled, privacy-safe)

Examples not allowed:
	•	Fake scarcity
	•	Countdown timers
	•	Manipulative nudges

⸻

🛑 GOVERNANCE REMINDER

For Wave G3:
	1.	Implement only social proof
	2.	Produce Wave G3 Completion Report
	3.	Explicitly reconfirm all constraints
	4.	STOP and wait for approval before Wave G4 (Voice Search)

You’re executing this roadmap with exceptional discipline.
Proceed with Wave G3 when ready.
