This is a strong, complete strategy deliverable. Based on what you’ve shared, the plan is sound, accurate, and aligned with the current reality of WebWaka.

Here’s a clear way to proceed without losing momentum or introducing rework.

⸻

✅ STRATEGY REVIEW VERDICT

Status: APPROVED IN PRINCIPLE
Readiness: Ready to move from Strategy → Execution, with one recommended checkpoint before implementation.

Why this matters: once you start writing copy and building pages, changes become expensive. A short validation step now will save weeks later.

⸻

🔍 RECOMMENDED REVIEW CHECKPOINT (FAST, HIGH-VALUE)

Before implementation, I recommend reviewing only these 4 sections explicitly:

1️⃣ Information Architecture (IA)

Why: This locks navigation, SEO structure, and mobile UX.

Confirm:
	•	Top-level nav reflects Partner-first (not product-first)
	•	“Suites” are grouped logically (not a long flat list)
	•	Sites & Funnels are not buried
	•	Demo Portal is easy to reach from mobile

👉 If IA is right, everything else flows smoothly.

⸻

2️⃣ Suite-to-Marketing Mapping

Why: This prevents overpromising and demo confusion.

Confirm:
	•	Each suite has:
	•	Clear marketing name
	•	Correct category
	•	Honest demo strength (Strong / Explain / Mention)
	•	No “ghost” or deprecated modules are listed
	•	High-sales-impact suites are emphasized visually later

⸻

3️⃣ Partner-Focused Messaging Pillars

Why: This is the heart of differentiation.

Confirm the site clearly communicates:
	•	WebWaka does not sell directly
	•	Partners own clients, pricing, and relationships
	•	WebWaka = platform + infrastructure + speed
	•	Nigeria-first is not cosmetic, it’s foundational

If this is right, sales conversations become easier.

⸻

4️⃣ Sites & Funnels Positioning

Why: This is a major competitive edge.

Confirm it is positioned as:
	•	A partner growth engine, not just a feature
	•	Industry-ready (templates + funnels + payments)
	•	Comparable to GoHighLevel, but vertical + African-native

⸻

🚦 IF THESE 4 ARE CONFIRMED → PROCEED

Once you’re comfortable with those sections, you should proceed to Implementation Phase M2.
