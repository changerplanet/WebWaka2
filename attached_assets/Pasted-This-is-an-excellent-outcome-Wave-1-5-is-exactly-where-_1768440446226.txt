This is an excellent outcome. Wave 1.5 is exactly where a serious platform earns its maturity badge.

You now have something very rare for a Nigeria-first commerce platform:

Foundational logic that is both context-aware and test-locked.

Let me respond in three parts:

⸻

✅ FORMAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Wave 1.5 is ACCEPTED and RECORDED as a baseline milestone.

I am explicitly noting and “locking in” the following as platform invariants going forward:

🔒 Locked Business Invariants (DO NOT BREAK LATER)
	•	Inventory conflict tolerance
	•	≤2 units oversell auto-accepted
	•	2 units requires manual resolution
	•	Price mismatch tolerance
	•	≤10% accepted
	•	10% flagged
	•	Commission default
	•	10% of subtotal (MVM baseline)
	•	Cash rounding rules
	•	< ₦1,000 → ₦5
	•	₦1,000–₦10,000 → ₦10
	•	≥ ₦10,000 → ₦50
	•	ParkHub departure logic
	•	WHEN_FULL triggers strictly on bookedSeats >= threshold
	•	Channel inventory modes
	•	SHARED / ALLOCATED / UNLIMITED are now contractually enforced

These are now contractual behaviors, not implementation details.

Any future enhancement must:
	•	Respect these invariants, or
	•	Explicitly version and migrate them (never silently change).

⸻

🧠 STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT (WHY THIS MATTERS)

You’ve just crossed a line most startups never do:

Before Wave 1.5	After Wave 1.5
“Works in demo”	Operationally reliable
Fear of refactor	Safe iteration
Fragile offline logic	Deterministic sync behavior
Nigeria assumptions undocumented	Nigeria logic codified + tested
Platform intuition	Platform contracts

This is the exact point where:
	•	Payments can be layered safely
	•	WhatsApp/SMS won’t create data chaos
	•	Partners can scale without inventory nightmares
	•	You can onboard informal vendors confidently

⸻

🔓 DECISION: WAVE 2 AUTHORIZATION

✅ Wave 2 is now UNLOCKED

Given:
	•	113 tests passing
	•	Logic thresholds explicitly documented
	•	Coverage scoped to the most dangerous areas

You are cleared to proceed with Wave 2.

⸻

📌 RECOMMENDED WAVE 2 SEQUENCE (DO NOT RUSH)

Wave 2 should focus on connectivity and trust, not more core logic.

🔢 Recommended Wave 2 Order
	1.	WhatsApp Integration (Notifications + Actions)
	•	Order confirmations
	•	POS receipts
	•	Vendor alerts
	•	ParkHub tickets
	2.	Bank Transfer & COD Deepening
	•	Proof upload
	•	Admin verification
	•	Timeout logic
	3.	Vendor Payout Execution (MVM)
	•	Daily/weekly payouts
	•	Threshold enforcement
	4.	Receipt Printing (POS + ParkHub)
	•	Bluetooth thermal printers
	5.	Offline-first UX Polishing
	•	Clear sync banners
	•	Conflict resolution UI

⚠️ Do NOT introduce:
	•	Automations
	•	AI logic
	•	Complex payouts splitting
	•	Drag-drop workflows
until Wave 2 is fully stable.

⸻

✅ WAVE 2 — FORMALLY AUTHORIZED

Authorization is hereby granted to proceed with Wave 2: Connectivity, Trust & Real-World Commerce Enablement, under the same governance, security, and stop-control rules used successfully in Wave 1 / 1.5.

This authorization is explicit, scoped, and conditional as follows:

⸻

🔓 WAVE 2 AUTHORIZATION STATEMENT

STATUS
	•	Wave 1: ✅ Complete
	•	Wave 1.5 (Test Locking): ✅ Complete
	•	Wave 2: 🟢 AUTHORIZED TO START
	•	Wave 3: 🔒 Locked (do not start)

⸻

🎯 WAVE 2 OBJECTIVE (RECONFIRMED)

Make the commerce platform trustworthy, usable, and operational in Nigerian conditions by strengthening:
	1.	Human communication channels (WhatsApp / SMS)
	2.	Cash & bank-transfer reality workflows
	3.	Vendor trust & payout clarity
	4.	Physical-world artifacts (receipts, tickets)
	5.	Offline → online UX clarity

This wave is about confidence, not new core logic.

⸻

⸻

🛑 REQUIRED STOP CONDITION (PER SUB-WAVE)

At the end of each Wave 2.x, Replit must:
	1.	Stop all work
	2.	Deliver a clear completion report
	3.	Wait for explicit approval to continue

No roll-ups. No batching.
