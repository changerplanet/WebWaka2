Excellent choice 👍
Option A — Priority Band 3 (Differentiators & Scale) is the correct next move now that the foundations are solid.

Below is a clear, execution-ready plan for Priority Band 3, structured exactly the way you’ve successfully run Waves F1–F9: sequenced, gated, Nigeria-aware, and safe.

⸻

🚀 PRIORITY BAND 3 — DIFFERENTIATORS & SCALE

Goal: Make WebWaka hard to compete with, sticky for vendors, and scalable across Nigeria & Africa.

These are not blockers, but they multiply value once the system is trusted and used.

⸻

🔢 FINAL CONFIRMED BAND 3 SCOPE (8 ITEMS)

From your list, these are the true Band 3 items:
	21.	Inventory Sync Engine (Advanced) ✅ DONE (Wave F9)
	22.	Vendor Rating System (MVM)
	23.	Offline Cart Persistence (SVM)
	24.	Social Proof (SVM)
	25.	SMS Ticketing (ParkHub)
	26.	Voice Product Search (POS)
	27.	Installment Payment Display (SVM)
	28.	Multi-Park Operator View (ParkHub)

So 7 items remain.

⸻

🧭 PROPOSED BAND 3 WAVE STRUCTURE

We should not do these all at once.
They fall naturally into 4 clean waves.

⸻

🟢 Wave G1 — Vendor Trust & Marketplace Quality (MVM)

🎯 Focus

Improve marketplace quality, buyer trust, and vendor accountability.

Scope

(22) Vendor Rating System

Why first in Band 3
	•	Depends on orders, payouts, fulfillment → already done
	•	Directly improves MVM credibility
	•	No risk to core commerce logic

What to Build
	•	Rating after DELIVERED orders only
	•	1–5 star rating + optional text
	•	Weighting rules:
	•	Recent orders weighted higher
	•	Cancelled/late orders affect score
	•	Vendor score buckets:
	•	Excellent / Good / Needs Attention
	•	Read-only impact (no vendor blocking yet)

Constraints
	•	❌ No automation
	•	❌ No punitive enforcement
	•	✅ Visibility only

📌 Output: Trust layer for MVM without governance risk

⸻

🟢 Wave G2 — Offline & Conversion Enhancements (SVM)

🎯 Focus

Increase conversion and reliability for online buyers.

Scope

(23) Offline Cart Persistence
(24) Social Proof

Why together
	•	Both live purely in SVM frontend
	•	IndexedDB + UI patterns
	•	No schema risk

Offline Cart Persistence
	•	Cart stored in IndexedDB
	•	Survives:
	•	Network loss
	•	Browser close
	•	App restart
	•	Syncs safely when back online
	•	Clear “Saved locally” indicators

Social Proof
	•	“X people bought this today”
	•	“Last bought 15 minutes ago”
	•	Aggregated, anonymized
	•	Demo-aware

Constraints
	•	❌ No dark patterns
	•	❌ No fake urgency
	•	❌ No notifications

📌 Output: Higher trust + better mobile reliability

⸻

🟢 Wave G3 — Nigeria Accessibility Layer (POS + ParkHub)

🎯 Focus

Reach users with feature phones, low literacy, shared devices.

Scope

(25) SMS Ticketing (ParkHub)
(26) Voice Product Search (POS)

SMS Ticketing (ParkHub)
	•	Passenger receives:
	•	Trip details
	•	Ticket code
	•	Boarding instructions
	•	Works without smartphones
	•	Integrated with existing F7 SMS infra

Voice Product Search (POS)
	•	Voice → text search
	•	Nigerian accent tolerance
	•	Local fuzzy matching
	•	Offline fallback (text only)

Constraints
	•	❌ No background listening
	•	❌ No AI training
	•	✅ User-initiated only

📌 Output: Inclusivity + speed in real Nigerian environments

⸻

🟢 Wave G4 — Scale Operators & Payment Flexibility

🎯 Focus

Support large operators and price-sensitive buyers.

Scope

(27) Installment Payment Display (SVM)
(28) Multi-Park Operator View (ParkHub)

Installment Display (UI-Only)
	•	“Pay ₦X today, ₦Y later” messaging
	•	No BNPL execution
	•	Works with:
	•	Paystack later
	•	Bank transfer
	•	Purely informational

Multi-Park Operator View
	•	Operators managing multiple parks
	•	Aggregated stats:
	•	Trips
	•	Revenue
	•	Agents
	•	Still tenant-scoped
	•	No cross-tenant leakage

📌 Output: Enterprise readiness without complexity

⸻

📅 FINAL BAND 3 EXECUTION ORDER

Wave	Scope	Risk	Impact
G1	Vendor Rating System	Low	High
G2	Offline Cart + Social Proof	Low	Medium–High
G3	SMS Ticketing + Voice Search	Medium	High
G4	Installments + Multi-Park View	Medium	Strategic


⸻

🛑 GOVERNANCE (UNCHANGED)

All existing rules remain in force:
	•	❌ No automation
	•	❌ No background jobs
	•	❌ No silent money movement
	•	❌ No breaking schema changes without approval
	•	✅ STOP after each wave
	•	✅ Explicit approval required per wave

⸻

✅ NEXT STEP — YOUR MOVE

✅ Wave G1 Authorized — Execution Begins

Authorization received.
I am now cleared to proceed with Wave G1: Vendor Rating System (MVM) under the established governance rules.

⸻

🔓 WAVE G1 — VENDOR RATING SYSTEM (MVM)

🎯 Objective (Reconfirmed)

Introduce a trust and quality layer for the Multi-Vendor Marketplace that:
	•	Improves buyer confidence
	•	Encourages vendor accountability
	•	Does not introduce enforcement, automation, or penalties

This is a read-only, visibility-first system.

⸻

🧱 SCOPE LOCK (Wave G1 ONLY)

INCLUDED
	•	Post-delivery vendor ratings (1–5 stars)
	•	Optional textual feedback
	•	Rating aggregation & weighting logic
	•	Vendor score bands (e.g. Excellent / Good / Needs Attention)
	•	Buyer-facing trust indicators
	•	Vendor-facing visibility of their own ratings
	•	Partner/Super Admin overview (read-only)

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED
	•	❌ No auto-penalties
	•	❌ No vendor blocking/suspension
	•	❌ No automation or background jobs
	•	❌ No incentives, rewards, or ranking manipulation
	•	❌ No notifications (email/SMS/WhatsApp)

⸻

🧠 DESIGN PRINCIPLES (Nigeria-First)
	•	Only DELIVERED orders can be rated
	•	One rating per order
	•	Recent orders weighted higher
	•	Cancelled / failed orders affect score weighting, not visibility
	•	Demo orders clearly marked and excluded by default
	•	Mobile-first UI (low bandwidth, low-end Android safe)

⸻

🧩 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (INTERNAL)

1. Data Layer
	•	mvm_vendor_rating
	•	mvm_vendor_rating_summary
	•	Tenant-isolated, order-linked, immutable after submission

2. Services
	•	VendorRatingService
	•	submitRating()
	•	getVendorRatings()
	•	getVendorScore()
	•	getRatingSummary()

3. APIs
	•	POST /api/commerce/vendor-ratings
	•	GET /api/commerce/vendor-ratings?vendorId=
	•	GET /api/commerce/vendor-ratings/summary

4. UI
	•	Buyer: simple post-delivery rating prompt
	•	Vendor: ratings overview (read-only)
	•	Marketplace: trust badge display
	•	Admin: vendor quality overview

⸻

🛑 GOVERNANCE CHECK

I confirm:
	•	❌ No automation
	•	❌ No background jobs
	•	❌ No schema/API spillover beyond ratings domain
	•	❌ No behavioral enforcement
	•	✅ STOP after Wave G1 completion

⸻

⏸️ NEXT REQUIRED ACTION

I will now implement Wave G1.

At completion, I will:
	1.	Deliver a Wave G1 Completion Report
	2.	List:
	•	Models created
	•	APIs added
	•	Weighting logic
	•	Demo vs live behavior
	3.	Explicitly confirm constraints
	4.	STOP and await your approval before Wave G2

Execution starting now.
