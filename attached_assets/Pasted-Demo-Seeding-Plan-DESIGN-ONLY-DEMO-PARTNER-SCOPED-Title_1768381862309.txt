Demo Seeding Plan (DESIGN ONLY, DEMO PARTNER–SCOPED)

Title: Design Demo Seeding Plan for WebWaka (Demo Partner Only — NO SEEDING)

Objective:
Design a comprehensive Demo Seeding Plan for the WebWaka platform that defines what demo data should exist, for which suites, for which roles, and for which use cases — strictly under the Demo Partner — without executing any seed scripts or modifying data.

⸻

🔒 STRICT RULES (MANDATORY)
	•	❌ DO NOT run any seed scripts
	•	❌ DO NOT create, update, or delete database records
	•	❌ DO NOT modify code, schema, or configuration
	•	❌ DO NOT add demo data
	•	✅ READ-ONLY analysis only
	•	✅ Produce documentation and recommendations only

⸻

🧭 DEMO PARTNER SCOPE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All demo design MUST adhere to the following:
	1.	All demo data belongs to ONE Demo Partner
	•	No multi-partner demo scenarios
	•	No cross-partner assumptions
	•	No production partners involved
	2.	Every demo use case MUST be explicitly assigned
	•	Assigned to:
	•	Demo Partner
	•	Demo Tenant(s) under that partner
	•	Specific user role(s)
	•	No “floating” or unassigned demo flows
	3.	No demo data may exist outside the Demo Partner context
	•	No global/system-only demo data
	•	No orphan records
	•	No admin-only demo artifacts unless tied to Demo Partner

⸻

📊 REQUIRED ANALYSIS

1️⃣ Platform Suite Inventory (Confirm Implementation)
For each implemented suite, list:
	•	Suite name
	•	Key modules / subsystems
	•	Primary user roles involved
	•	Whether the suite is visible in the Demo Partner UI

Suites to include (confirm completeness and add any missing):
	•	Commerce (POS / SVM / MVM)
	•	Sites & Funnels
	•	Logistics
	•	Hospitality
	•	Civic
	•	Health
	•	Education
	•	Real Estate
	•	Recruitment
	•	Project Management
	•	Church
	•	Political
	•	Any other detected suites

⸻

2️⃣ Demo Necessity Classification (Per Suite)
For each suite, classify demo requirement as:
	•	REQUIRED FOR DEMO — must have seeded demo data
	•	OPTIONAL (UI-ONLY OK) — static/empty-state demo acceptable
	•	NOT REQUIRED FOR DEMO — hidden or admin-only

Each classification must include:
	•	Business justification
	•	Demo risk if omitted
	•	Impact on sales/demo narrative

⸻

3️⃣ Demo Persona & Role Mapping (Demo Partner Only)
Define conceptual personas only (no credentials):
	•	Partner-level roles:
	•	Partner Owner
	•	Partner Admin
	•	Partner Staff
	•	Partner Viewer (lowest privilege)
	•	End-user personas per suite, all scoped to Demo Partner:
	•	e.g. Student, Patient, Guest, Voter, Customer, Congregant

For each persona:
	•	Assigned suite(s)
	•	Assigned module(s)
	•	Assigned demo use cases

⸻

4️⃣ Demo Use Case Assignment (CRITICAL)
For each suite, list:
	•	Core demo use cases (CRUD, workflows, reports, dashboards)
	•	Which role executes each use case
	•	Which Demo Tenant owns the data
	•	Whether cross-suite linkage exists (e.g. CRM → Commerce → Logistics)

⚠️ No use case may remain unassigned.

⸻

5️⃣ Demo Data Depth Recommendation
For each suite, recommend one level:
	•	Level 0 – Hidden from demo
	•	Level 1 – Minimal (lists + empty states)
	•	Level 2 – Functional (end-to-end workflows)
	•	Level 3 – Narrative (realistic history, reports, analytics)

Include rationale tied to demo value.

⸻

6️⃣ Seed Script Mapping (Design Only)
For each suite:
	•	Existing seed scripts (if any)
	•	Missing seed scripts that should be created
	•	Which demo use cases each script would support
	•	Execution priority order

⚠️ Mapping only — do not execute.

⸻

7️⃣ Demo Tenant Strategy
Recommend:
	•	Number of Demo Tenants under Demo Partner
	•	Purpose of each tenant (e.g. Education tenant, Commerce tenant)
	•	Isolation rules
	•	Safeguards preventing demo data from leaking into production

⸻

📄 REQUIRED DELIVERABLES

Create documentation only under /frontend/docs/:
	1.	DEMO_SEEDING_STRATEGY.md
	2.	DEMO_SUITE_PRIORITY_MATRIX.md
	3.	DEMO_PERSONA_AND_USECASE_MAP.md
	4.	DEMO_SEED_SCRIPT_PLAN.md
	5.	DEMO_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md

Each document must:
	•	Explicitly reference Demo Partner
	•	Explicitly assign every use case
	•	Be decision-ready (not exploratory)

⸻

🛑 STOP CONDITION

After producing the documents:
	•	STOP
	•	Do not seed data
	•	Do not propose code changes
	•	Await explicit approval before any execution phase

⸻

Purpose Reminder:
This plan exists to enable a controlled, sales-ready, and safe demo environment where every workflow is intentional, owned, and testable under the Demo Partner.
