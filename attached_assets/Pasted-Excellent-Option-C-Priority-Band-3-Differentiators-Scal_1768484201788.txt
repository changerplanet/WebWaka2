Excellent. ✅
Option C — Priority Band 3 (Differentiators & Scale) is now formally activated.

Below is a clear, sequenced execution plan that respects everything we’ve learned so far: Nigeria-first realities, offline-first constraints, demo safety, and governance discipline (wave-by-wave authorization).

⸻

🚀 PRIORITY BAND 3 — EXECUTION PLAN

Theme: Differentiators & Scale
Philosophy: These features do not block commerce, but once live, they make WebWaka hard to compete with.

We will proceed in five tightly scoped waves, each independently valuable and low-risk.

⸻

🟢 WAVE G1 — Vendor Rating System (MVM)

Why First
	•	Improves marketplace trust
	•	Low technical risk
	•	No financial side effects
	•	Purely additive and read-only at first

Scope

Rating Sources
	•	Order completion (auto-eligible)
	•	Manual admin moderation (no automation)

Data Model
	•	mvm_vendor_rating
	•	mvm_vendor_rating_summary

Capabilities
	•	1–5 star ratings
	•	Optional text review
	•	Aggregate score (avg, count, trend)
	•	“Verified Purchase” badge
	•	Demo-safe labeling

Constraints
	•	❌ No incentives
	•	❌ No ranking manipulation
	•	❌ No automation
	•	❌ No public shaming (hidden low ratings until volume threshold)

Outcome
	•	Marketplace trust layer
	•	Foundation for future discovery & ranking

⛔ STOP required after Wave G1

⸻

🟢 WAVE G2 — Offline Cart Persistence (SVM)

Why Second
	•	Complements POS offline strength
	•	Directly improves conversion
	•	Highly Nigeria-relevant (network drops mid-browse)

Scope

Offline Cart Layer
	•	IndexedDB-backed cart storage
	•	Auto-restore on reconnect
	•	Versioned cart schema

Behavior
	•	Cart survives:
	•	App close
	•	Network loss
	•	Browser refresh
	•	Graceful conflict resolution:
	•	Price change
	•	Stock change
	•	Removed items

UX Signals
	•	“Saved offline” badge
	•	“Price changed” notice
	•	Retry + edit prompts

Constraints
	•	❌ No background sync
	•	❌ No auto checkout
	•	❌ User-triggered restore only

Outcome
	•	Dramatically reduced cart abandonment
	•	Trust in unstable connectivity

⛔ STOP required after Wave G2

⸻

🟢 WAVE G3 — Social Proof (SVM)

Why Third
	•	Conversion booster
	•	Leverages existing data
	•	No operational risk

Scope

Signals Introduced
	•	“X people bought this today”
	•	“Last purchased 2h ago”
	•	“Popular in your area” (LGA/state scoped)
	•	Vendor trust badges (from Wave G1)

Data Sources
	•	Completed orders only
	•	Demo clearly labeled
	•	Cached aggregates (no real-time pressure)

UX
	•	Lightweight badges
	•	No dark patterns
	•	No fake urgency

Constraints
	•	❌ No countdown timers
	•	❌ No artificial scarcity
	•	❌ No automation

Outcome
	•	Improved buyer confidence
	•	Higher checkout completion

⛔ STOP required after Wave G3

⸻

🟢 WAVE G4 — Voice Product Search (POS)

Why Fourth
	•	Accessibility & speed feature
	•	Valuable in noisy retail environments
	•	Strong Nigeria-specific usability

Scope

Search Modes
	•	Voice → text → fuzzy match
	•	Fallback to manual search

Optimizations
	•	Nigerian accents (basic tolerance)
	•	Partial word matching
	•	SKU + nickname matching

UX
	•	Push-to-talk button
	•	Clear listening / processing states
	•	Confidence display (“Searching for ‘Paracetamol’”)

Offline Behavior
	•	❌ No voice offline
	•	Clear message: “Voice search requires internet”

Constraints
	•	❌ No AI inference layer
	•	❌ Browser-native Speech API only

Outcome
	•	Faster POS operations
	•	Accessibility differentiator

⛔ STOP required after Wave G4

⸻

🟢 WAVE G5 — Multi-Park Operator View (ParkHub)

Why Last
	•	Scale feature
	•	Targets mature operators
	•	Depends on stable ParkHub core (already achieved)

Scope

Operator Dashboard
	•	Multiple parks under one operator
	•	Aggregated:
	•	Trips
	•	Revenue
	•	Tickets sold
	•	Cash vs transfer breakdown

Controls
	•	Park-level filters
	•	Date range filters
	•	Export (CSV only)

Authorization
	•	Operator role only
	•	No cross-tenant visibility

Constraints
	•	❌ No automation
	•	❌ No payouts
	•	❌ Read-only analytics

Outcome
	•	Enables enterprise-scale transport operators
	•	Differentiates ParkHub strongly

⛔ STOP required after Wave G5
