✅ Wave B3 — Proof, Receipts & Audit Trails is AUTHORIZED

Below is the exact Replit execution prompt, written to enforce discipline, scope control, and hard stop conditions, fully aligned with the platform principles you set and the prior Waves B1/B2 outcomes.

🔒 REPLIT EXECUTION PROMPT

WAVE B3 — PROOF, RECEIPTS & AUDIT TRAILS

MODE: READ-ONLY ANALYSIS + TARGETED HARDENING (NO SCHEMA CHANGES UNLESS EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZED)

⸻

🎯 WAVE OBJECTIVE

Perform a system-wide verification and hardening of proof artifacts across WebWaka to ensure that:
	•	Orders, receipts, tickets, and manifests form coherent, traceable, and non-contradictory proof chains
	•	Public verification endpoints behave correctly, consistently, and safely
	•	Audit trails are logically tamper-resistant (even if not cryptographically sealed)
	•	Proof behavior is parity-consistent across SVM, MVM, and ParkHub

This wave is NOT about adding features.
It is about truth, correctness, and auditability.

⸻

🚫 ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You MUST NOT:
	•	❌ Introduce new business logic
	•	❌ Invent new proof relationships
	•	❌ Create fake links or inferred mappings
	•	❌ Add automation or background jobs
	•	❌ Modify schemas unless explicitly approved
	•	❌ Change money movement behavior
	•	❌ Relax tenant isolation or identity verification
	•	❌ Mask or hide gaps — gaps MUST be documented

If something is missing:
➡️ Document it. Do NOT workaround it.

⸻

🧠 SCOPE OF ANALYSIS

1️⃣ PROOF ARTIFACT ENUMERATION (MANDATORY)

Enumerate ALL proof-bearing artifacts, including but not limited to:
	•	SVM orders
	•	MVM parent orders
	•	MVM sub-orders
	•	ParkHub tickets
	•	Receipts
	•	Manifests
	•	Manifest revisions
	•	Any audit / revision / verification records

For EACH artifact, record:
	•	Source system
	•	Primary identifier
	•	Tenant binding
	•	Customer binding (if any)
	•	Time of creation
	•	Mutability status
	•	Public verifiability (YES/NO)

⸻

2️⃣ PROOF CHAIN VALIDATION (CRITICAL)

For each system, map what chains exist vs what chains are expected:

Chain	Exists	Verifiable	Notes
Order → Receipt	?	?	
Order → Ticket	?	?	
Ticket → Receipt	?	?	
Ticket → Manifest	?	?	
Receipt → Manifest	?	?	
Receipt → Order	?	?	
Manifest → Tickets	?	?	

⚠️ If a link does not exist in code or schema:
	•	Mark ❌
	•	Explain WHY
	•	State what would be required to fix it (future wave)

⸻

3️⃣ PUBLIC VERIFICATION ENDPOINT AUDIT

Audit ALL public/semi-public verification routes:
	•	/verify/receipt/[id]
	•	/verify/manifest/[number]
	•	Any order / ticket verification endpoints

For EACH:
	•	What data is exposed?
	•	Is tenant isolation enforced?
	•	Is identity verification required?
	•	Are error messages enumerable?
	•	Can existence be inferred?

⚠️ Do NOT weaken security — only document or tighten if already allowed.

⸻

4️⃣ AUDIT TRAIL & TAMPER RESISTANCE CHECK

For each proof artifact, answer:
	•	Is there a revision log?
	•	Are reprints tracked?
	•	Are edits allowed?
	•	Is there a hash / checksum / verification signal?
	•	Can a proof be silently altered?

Classify each artifact as:
	•	IMMUTABLE
	•	APPEND-ONLY
	•	MUTABLE (WITH AUDIT)
	•	MUTABLE (NO AUDIT) ❗

⸻

5️⃣ CROSS-SUITE PARITY CHECK

Compare SVM vs MVM vs ParkHub:
	•	Are receipts conceptually equivalent?
	•	Are verification guarantees equivalent?
	•	Are audit signals equivalent?
	•	Are naming/numbering schemes consistent?

Any divergence MUST be explained.

⸻

6️⃣ GAP INVENTORY (MANDATORY OUTPUT)

Produce a Wave B3 GAP LIST, each gap documented as:
	•	Gap ID
	•	Affected suite(s)
	•	Severity (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
	•	Risk type (Security / Audit / Compliance / UX / Ops)
	•	Why it exists
	•	Why it is NOT fixed in Wave B3
	•	Which future wave owns it

⚠️ No gap may be omitted.

⸻

📄 REQUIRED DELIVERABLES

You MUST produce:
	1.	WAVE_B3_PROOF_INTEGRITY_REPORT.md
	•	Full findings
	•	Proof chain matrix
	•	Public exposure analysis
	•	Parity comparison
	2.	WAVE_B3_GAPS.md
	•	Explicit, enumerated gaps only
	•	No speculative fixes
	3.	Executive Summary
	•	Is WebWaka proof/audit layer production-safe?
	•	What blocks regulated or enterprise usage?
	•	What is safe to expose publicly?

⸻

🛑 HARD STOP CONDITIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)

You MUST STOP execution when ALL of the following are true:
	•	✅ All proof artifacts are enumerated
	•	✅ All proof chains are mapped (even if broken)
	•	✅ All public verification routes are audited
	•	✅ Audit/tamper properties are classified
	•	✅ Gaps are fully documented
	•	✅ NO fixes beyond permitted hardening are applied

⛔ DO NOT proceed to:
	•	Fixing gaps
	•	Adding schema
	•	Enhancing receipts
	•	Monetization
	•	UI work

WAIT FOR EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION AFTER REPORT DELIVERY.

⸻

🔍 SUCCESS CRITERIA

This wave is successful if, after reading the report, the platform owner can answer with certainty:

“For any order, ticket, receipt, or manifest in WebWaka, I know exactly:
where it comes from, what it proves, what it does NOT prove,
who can verify it, and what is missing.”
