FULL PLATFORM BUG HUNT (READ-ONLY)

Objective

Conduct a comprehensive, systematic bug hunt across the entire WebWaka platform, identifying all bugs, defects, inconsistencies, and unintended behaviors — technical, UI, UX, logic, data, and flow-related — without proposing new features or enhancements.

This phase is strictly about what is broken, incorrect, confusing, or unreliable today.
