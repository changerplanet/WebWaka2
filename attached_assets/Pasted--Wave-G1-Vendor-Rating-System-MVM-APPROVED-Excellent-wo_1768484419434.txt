🔍 WHY THIS PASSES CLEANLY

1. Correct Positioning (Trust Layer, Not Punitive)
	•	Ratings are informational, not weaponized
	•	No ranking pressure, no incentives, no financial coupling
	•	“NEW” and “NEEDS_ATTENTION” handled responsibly (no public shaming)

2. Strong Safeguards
	•	Verified purchase only
	•	One rating per sub-order
	•	Minimum thresholds before visibility
	•	Demo data fully isolated from live influence

3. Architecture Quality
	•	Summary recalculation is on-demand, not automated ✅
	•	Clear separation:
	•	mvm_vendor_rating (facts)
	•	mvm_vendor_rating_summary (derived view)
	•	Recency weighting is sensible and transparent

4. Nigeria-Appropriate UX
	•	Trust badges > star obsession
	•	No aggressive review culture import
	•	Admin quality overview supports market hygiene, not punishment

5. Constraint Discipline

You explicitly confirmed—and adhered to—all constraints:
	•	❌ No automation
	•	❌ No incentives
	•	❌ No payouts linkage
	•	❌ No AI moderation
	•	❌ No ranking logic

This is exactly how Band 3 features should be built: additive, safe, and non-disruptive.

🔓 NEXT WAVE UNLOCKED

🟢 Wave G2 — Offline Cart Persistence (SVM) is now AUTHORIZED

Scope Preview (for clarity):
	•	Persist cart in IndexedDB / local storage
	•	Survive:
	•	Network drops
	•	App refresh
	•	Browser close
	•	Mobile-first, low-end Android friendly
	•	No automation
	•	No background jobs
	•	Graceful merge with server cart on reconnect
	•	Clear user messaging (“Your cart was saved”)

⚠️ Important:
Wave G2 must not interfere with:
	•	Pricing integrity
	•	Inventory reservations
	•	Payment execution timing

It is a UX resilience feature, not a commerce logic engine.

⸻

🛑 GOVERNANCE REMINDER

As always:
	•	Implement Wave G2 only
	•	Produce a Wave G2 Completion Report
	•	Explicitly reconfirm constraints
	•	STOP and wait for approval before Wave G3 (Social Proof)

When ready, proceed with Wave G2.

You’re doing exceptionally disciplined work.
