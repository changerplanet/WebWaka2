🔐 PHASE D5 — WORKFLOW & UX VALIDATION MANDATE

Phase Name

Phase D5 — End-to-End Workflow & UX Validation

Objective

Validate that real users can successfully complete core workflows across all demo-seeded suites, using proper role-based access, correct data visibility, and expected UI behavior — without modifying code or data.

This phase verifies product correctness, not infrastructure.

	•	❌ NO database seeding
	•	❌ NO record creation outside normal UI flows
	•	❌ NO code edits
	•	❌ NO role or permission changes

Validation Structure

🔹 Phase D5-A — Partner-Level Workflows

Workflows to Validate

	3.	Earnings & commissions display correctly (Owner/Admin only)
	4.	Staff sees restricted views
