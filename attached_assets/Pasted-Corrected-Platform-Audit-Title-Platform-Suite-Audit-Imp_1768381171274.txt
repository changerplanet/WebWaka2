Corrected Platform Audit

Title: Platform Suite Audit — Implementation vs Demo Seeding (Corrected Scope)

Objective
Re-run a full platform audit with a clear separation between:
	1.	Suite / Module implementation status (code, API, UI, permissions exist)
	2.	Demo data seeding status (sample records exist for demo/testing)

⚠️ Previous audit incorrectly treated “no demo data” as “not implemented.”
This audit must explicitly distinguish the two.

⸻

Scope & Rules (STRICT)
	•	READ-ONLY analysis
	•	❌ Do NOT modify code, database, schema, or configuration
	•	❌ Do NOT run seed scripts
	•	❌ Do NOT create or delete data
	•	❌ Do NOT deploy anything
	•	Analysis and documentation only

⸻

Suites to Audit (Include ALL that exist)

Confirm presence and status for each of the following suites and any others discovered:
	•	Commerce (POS / SVM / MVM)
	•	Sites & Funnels
	•	Logistics
	•	Hospitality
	•	Civic
	•	Health
	•	Education
	•	Real Estate
	•	Recruitment
	•	Project Management
	•	Church
	•	Political
	•	Any additional suites found in codebase

⸻

For EACH Suite, Determine and Report:

1️⃣ Implementation Status (YES / NO)
A suite is IMPLEMENTED if:
	•	API routes exist
	•	UI routes/pages exist
	•	Prisma models exist
	•	Permissions/RBAC are defined
	•	Partner access can be assigned

Demo data is NOT required for this.

2️⃣ Demo Seeding Status (SEEDED / NOT SEEDED / PARTIAL)
A suite is DEMO-SEEDED if:
	•	At least one seed script exists OR
	•	Records exist in database for demo partner

⸻

Deliverables (REQUIRED)

Produce three clear artifacts:

📄 1. SUITE_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX.md
Table with:
	•	Suite Name
	•	Implemented (YES / NO)
	•	Evidence (folders, APIs, models)

📄 2. DEMO_SEEDING_MATRIX.md
Table with:
	•	Suite Name
	•	Demo Seeded (YES / NO / PARTIAL)
	•	Seed Script Exists (YES / NO)
	•	Tables with Records (YES / NO)

📄 3. AUDIT_SUMMARY.md
Include:
	•	Total suites implemented
	•	Total suites demo-seeded
	•	Clear statement:
“Lack of demo data does NOT imply lack of implementation.”

⸻

Important Clarifications (MANDATORY)
	•	Do NOT label a suite as “blocked” or “not ready” solely due to missing demo data
	•	Demo seeding is a separate readiness dimension
	•	Use precise language:
	•	“Implemented but not demo-seeded”
	•	“Implemented and demo-seeded”
	•	“Not implemented” (only if code truly does not exist)

⸻

Final Output Requirement

End the report with this exact section:

Corrected Verdict
	•	Platform implementation status:
	•	Demo data readiness status:
	•	What is missing is demo seeding, not system capability.

⸻

Stop after producing the documentation.
Do NOT apply fixes or recommendations beyond factual reporting.
