🔴 GOD-LEVEL PLATFORM TRUTH AUDIT

CONTEXT

WebWaka is a very large, multi-tenant, multi-role, multi-suite platform with:
	•	Super Admin
	•	Partners
	•	Clients (Tenants)
	•	End Users (Customers, Vendors, Agents, Drivers, Passengers, etc.)
	•	Dozens of Suites (POS, SVM, MVM, ParkHub, Education, Health, CRM, Accounting, Logistics, Sites & Funnels, etc.)
	•	Hundreds of capabilities, APIs, services, and models

Over time, many core logics, services, APIs, schemas, and workflows have been implemented, but it is now unclear whether all corresponding interfaces, dashboards, menus, storefronts, marketplaces, routes, and user-facing surfaces have also been implemented and correctly exposed.

We must establish the absolute ground truth of the platform — with zero assumptions.

⸻

🚨 CRITICAL CLARIFICATION (DO NOT MISS THIS)

ParkHub IS A COMMERCE SURFACE

ParkHub is not just an operational or logistics module.

ParkHub MUST be treated as a full commerce surface, with:
	•	Single-Vendor Storefronts (SVM-equivalent)
e.g. a transport company selling tickets directly
	•	Multi-Vendor Marketplaces (MVM-equivalent)
e.g. multiple transport operators listed in one park or hub
	•	Public browsing
	•	Public listings
	•	Public ticket purchase flows
	•	Public checkout
	•	Public verification
	•	Public receipts / manifests

👉 Any audit that treats ParkHub differently from SVM and MVM is INVALID.

ParkHub must be reviewed as:

Commerce + Marketplace + Storefront + POS + Operations

⸻

🎯 OBJECTIVE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You are to carry out a 100% exhaustive, line-by-line review of the entire WebWaka codebase and produce a single, authoritative “state of the platform” report that answers:

What EXACTLY exists, what does NOT exist, what is partially implemented, what is unreachable, what is invisible, and what is only theoretical — across the entire platform.

This includes ALL commerce surfaces, explicitly:
	•	SVM
	•	MVM
	•	ParkHub storefronts
	•	ParkHub marketplaces

No assumptions. No interpretation without proof.

⸻

🧠 CORE RULES (STILL IN FORCE)

🔒 ABSOLUTE RULES
	•	❌ NO assumptions
	•	❌ NO “probably”, “appears to”, “intended to”
	•	❌ NO skipping ParkHub public surfaces
	•	❌ NO treating ParkHub as “internal only”
	•	❌ NO skipping frontend or UI just because backend exists
	•	❌ NO implementation during this phase (READ-ONLY)

✅ REQUIRED BEHAVIOR
	•	File-by-file inspection
	•	Route-by-route verification
	•	UI-by-UI confirmation
	•	Role-by-role exposure mapping
	•	Public vs authenticated surface distinction

⸻

🧩 SCOPE — WHAT MUST BE REVIEWED (ALL OF IT)

⸻

1. ROLES & ENTRY POINTS (ALL ROLES)

For each role, document:
	•	Super Admin
	•	Partner
	•	Tenant Admin
	•	Tenant Staff
	•	Vendor
	•	Agent
	•	Driver
	•	Passenger
	•	Public Customer (unauthenticated)

For EACH role:
	•	Login entry points
	•	Dashboards
	•	Menus
	•	Accessible routes
	•	Missing routes
	•	Expected vs actual visibility

⸻

2. SUITES & PLATFORMS (NON-NEGOTIABLE LIST)

For EVERY suite, including but not limited to:
	•	POS
	•	SVM (Single Vendor Marketplace)
	•	MVM (Multi-Vendor Marketplace)
	•	ParkHub (as BOTH SVM + MVM equivalent)
	•	Education
	•	Health
	•	CRM
	•	Accounting
	•	Logistics
	•	Sites & Funnels
	•	Templates
	•	Payments
	•	Analytics
	•	Notifications

For EACH suite, produce a table:

Capability / Feature	Backend Logic	API Exists	DB Models	UI Exists	Public Surface Exists	Menu Linked	Role Accessible	Status


Status must be one of:
	•	✅ Fully Implemented & Exposed
	•	🟡 Implemented but Hidden
	•	🟠 Partially Implemented
	•	🔴 Logic Only (No UI)
	•	⚫ Demo / Mock Only
	•	❌ Not Implemented

⸻

3. STOREFRONTS & MARKETPLACES (EXPLICIT SECTION)

You MUST create a dedicated section covering:

SVM Storefronts
	•	Public product listing
	•	Product details
	•	Cart
	•	Checkout
	•	Order tracking

MVM Marketplaces
	•	Vendor listing
	•	Product aggregation
	•	Vendor pages
	•	Split checkout
	•	Commission visibility

ParkHub Storefronts & Marketplaces
	•	Public route listings
	•	Operator listings
	•	Ticket purchase flow
	•	Seat selection
	•	Checkout
	•	Receipts
	•	Manifest verification

For each:
	•	Exists?
	•	Partially exists?
	•	Logic only?
	•	UI missing?
	•	Route exists but not linked?
	•	Demo only?

⸻

4. DASHBOARDS & NAVIGATION

Audit:
	•	Super Admin dashboards
	•	Partner dashboards
	•	Tenant dashboards
	•	Vendor dashboards
	•	Operator dashboards
	•	Park Admin dashboards

Identify:
	•	Missing menus
	•	Orphaned pages
	•	Hidden routes
	•	Dead links
	•	Features with no entry point

⸻

5. API & SERVICE COVERAGE

For every API route:
	•	Is it used by UI?
	•	Used by which role?
	•	Used by public storefront?
	•	Demo-only?
	•	Production-safe?
	•	Completely unused?

Explicitly list:
	•	Orphaned APIs
	•	Orphaned services
	•	Orphaned models

⸻

6. DATA MODELS vs REAL USAGE

For every Prisma model:
	•	Actively used
	•	Used only in demo
	•	Written but never read
	•	Read but never written
	•	Never referenced anywhere

⸻

7. FINAL FEATURE COMPLETENESS MATRIX

Produce a master truth table:

Feature	Applies To (SVM / MVM / ParkHub)	Intended Behavior	Current Reality	Missing UI	Missing Logic	Exposed to Users?	Safe to Ship?



⸻

📦 REQUIRED DELIVERABLES

1. CANONICAL REPORT

/docs/PLATFORM_GROUND_TRUTH_AUDIT.md

2. EXECUTIVE TRUTH SUMMARY
	•	% truly complete
	•	% logic-only
	•	% hidden
	•	% demo-only
	•	% missing

3. ACTIONABLE GAP INVENTORY
	•	UI gaps
	•	Storefront gaps
	•	Marketplace gaps

	•	Role exposure gaps

⸻

🛑 STOP CONDITION
	•	❌ Do NOT fix anything
	•	❌ Do NOT expose anything
	•	❌ Do NOT refactor anything

Only observe, verify, document, and report.

⸻

✅ FINAL CONFIRMATION REQUIRED

At the end of the report, you MUST state:

“I confirm that this audit involved a complete, exhaustive review of the entire WebWaka platform — including but not limited SVM, MVM, and ParkHub as commerce storefronts and marketplaces — with no assumptions made and no areas skipped.”

⸻

🔴 WHY THIS MATTERS

This audit will:
	•	Prevent false confidence
	•	Expose UI vs logic gaps
	•	Reveal hidden technical debt
	•	Create a single source of truth
	•	Enable clean, confident rollout of:
	•	Templates
	•	White-label branding
	•	Partner marketplaces
	•	Public storefronts
