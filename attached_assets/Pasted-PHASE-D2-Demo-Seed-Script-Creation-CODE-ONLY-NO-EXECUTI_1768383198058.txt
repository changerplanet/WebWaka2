PHASE D2

Demo Seed Script Creation (CODE ONLY — NO EXECUTION)

READ CAREFULLY. THIS PHASE IS DESIGN & CODE CREATION ONLY.

⸻

CONTEXT

You are working on WebWaka, a large multi-suite SaaS platform.
The platform is fully implemented, but demo readiness is blocked only due to missing demo data.

A Demo Seeding Strategy and Priority Matrix has already been approved.
Your task is to CREATE seed scripts ONLY — DO NOT run them.

	4.	Follow layered seeding structure:
	•	Configuration
	•	Operational entities
	•	Transactions / history
	5.	Be idempotent-safe (guard against duplicates)
	6.	Use realistic African-context sample data
	7.	Include this header:

/**
 * Demo Seed Script — DESIGN ONLY
 * PHASE D2
 * DO NOT EXECUTE WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL
 */
