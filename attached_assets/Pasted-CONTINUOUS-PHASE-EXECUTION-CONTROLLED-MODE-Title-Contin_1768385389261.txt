CONTINUOUS PHASE EXECUTION (CONTROLLED MODE)

Title: Continuous Demo Readiness Execution — Controlled Phased Mode

⸻

You are authorized to proceed with the remaining Demo Readiness Phases sequentially, nonstop, under strict phase boundaries and safety rules.

GLOBAL RULES (MANDATORY)
	1.	One phase at a time — fully complete, verify, and report before moving to the next.
	2.	No skipping phases.
	3.	No mixing execution with design.
	4.	All demo data MUST belong exclusively to the WebWaka Demo Partner and its demo tenants.
	5.	No production data, no schema changes, no business logic changes.
	6.	If a blocking issue is discovered, STOP immediately and report.
	7.	After each phase, produce a clear “Phase Completion Report” before continuing.
