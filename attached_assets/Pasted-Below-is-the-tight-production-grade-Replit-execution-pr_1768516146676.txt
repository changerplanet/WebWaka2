Below is the tight, production-grade Replit execution prompt for Wave I.3 — ParkHub Public Operator Marketplace.
It is written to be unambiguous, enforce constraints, and align with everything learned from Waves I.1 and I.2.

🔷 REPLIT EXECUTION PROMPT

Wave I.3 — ParkHub Public Operator Marketplace (Exposure Only)

CONTEXT

WebWaka is a multi-tenant Nigeria-first platform.
ParkHub is not just a booking flow — it is a transport commerce marketplace, equivalent in concept to:
	•	SVM → single-vendor storefront
	•	MVM → multi-vendor marketplace
	•	ParkHub → transport operator marketplace

At present:
	•	ParkHub booking (/parkhub/booking) exists and works
	•	Walk-up POS exists
	•	Operator dashboards exist
	•	Backend models and APIs for operators, routes, trips, tickets already exist

What is missing is PUBLIC EXPOSURE, not logic.

⸻

🎯 WAVE I.3 OBJECTIVE

Expose ParkHub as a public marketplace of transport operators and routes, using ONLY existing backend logic, models, and services.

This wave is READ-ONLY EXPOSURE ONLY.

⸻

🧱 HARD CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You MUST comply with all of the following:

❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
	•	❌ No new business logic
	•	❌ No new booking logic
	•	❌ No new pricing logic
	•	❌ No schema changes
	•	❌ No automation
	•	❌ No background jobs
	•	❌ No new services that alter behavior
	•	❌ No “temporary” workaround logic
	•	❌ No inferred behavior

✅ ALLOWED
	•	✅ New routes/pages
	•	✅ New read-only UI components
	•	✅ Server-side resolvers that call existing services or Prisma directly
	•	✅ Demo-safe behavior where already present
	•	✅ 404 gating for invalid or inactive tenants/operators
	•	✅ SEO metadata

🔴 CRITICAL RULE

If a required capability does not exist, you MUST document it as a GAP.
DO NOT invent or simulate missing behavior.

📦 SCOPE OF WORK

1. PUBLIC PARKHUB LANDING (TENANT-SCOPED)

Route:

/[tenantSlug]/parkhub

Purpose:
	•	Entry point for ParkHub commerce under a tenant
	•	Introduces ParkHub as a transport marketplace

Must show (read-only):
	•	List of active transport operators under the tenant
	•	Count of active routes/trips (derived from existing data)
	•	CTA to explore operators or routes

Must NOT:
	•	Perform bookings directly
	•	Modify data
	•	Show admin-only information

⸻

2. OPERATOR LISTING (MARKETPLACE VIEW)

Route:

/[tenantSlug]/parkhub/operators

Purpose:
Public marketplace listing of transport companies/operators.

Data sources (existing only):
	•	park operators / vendors
	•	park assignments
	•	routes/trips already linked to operators

Operator cards should display ONLY IF DATA EXISTS:
	•	Operator name
	•	Assigned parks
	•	Cities/regions served (if available)
	•	Active routes count (derived)
	•	Trust/verification badge (if exists)

❗ If some fields (e.g. logo, description) do not exist → document as GAP

⸻

3. OPERATOR PROFILE PAGE

Route:

/[tenantSlug]/parkhub/operator/[operatorSlug]

Purpose:
Public-facing operator storefront.

Expose (read-only):
	•	Operator identity
	•	Assigned parks
	•	Routes operated
	•	Available trips (summary view)
	•	Link into booking flow (existing /parkhub/booking)

Do NOT:
	•	Duplicate booking logic
	•	Show internal admin data
	•	Create new availability calculations

⸻

4. PUBLIC ROUTE & SCHEDULE BROWSER

Route:

/[tenantSlug]/parkhub/routes

Purpose:
Allow users to browse routes/schedules outside the booking funnel.

Expose:
	•	Origin → destination routes
	•	Operators serving each route
	•	Upcoming trips (summary only)

Important:
	•	Use the SAME data the booking flow already uses
	•	This is read-only discovery, not booking

⸻

🔐 TENANT & SAFETY RULES
	•	Tenant MUST be resolved server-side via tenantSlug
	•	Tenant must be:
	•	ACTIVE
	•	ParkHub-enabled
	•	Invalid or suspended tenants → 404
	•	Demo tenants must continue to work

⸻

🧪 DEMO & TESTING

You MUST verify:
	•	/demo-tenant/parkhub → 200
	•	Invalid tenant → 404
	•	Tenant without ParkHub enabled → 404
	•	Operator with no public data → still renders safely
	•	Booking links correctly forward into existing booking flow

⸻

📝 REQUIRED OUTPUT: WAVE I.3 COMPLETION REPORT

At the end of the work, produce a report titled:

WAVE I.3 COMPLETION REPORT — ParkHub Public Operator Marketplace

It MUST include:

1. Routes Implemented

| Route | Purpose | Status |

2. Existing Services / Models Used

(List exact services, Prisma models, or query patterns used)

3. UI Components
	•	Reused components
	•	Newly created read-only components

4. Demo vs Live Behavior
	•	How demo tenants behave
	•	Any limitations

5. Explicit Confirmations

You MUST explicitly state:
	•	❌ No new business logic
	•	❌ No schema changes
	•	❌ No automation
	•	❌ No background jobs

6. GAP LIST (MANDATORY)

Document every missing capability discovered, for example:
	•	Missing public operator metadata
	•	Missing route summaries
	•	Missing schedule visibility
	•	Missing SEO fields

Each GAP must include:
	•	What is missing
	•	Why it cannot be solved in Wave I
	•	That it is deferred to post–Wave I gap resolution

⸻

🛑 STOP CONDITION

When Wave I.3 is complete:
	•	STOP immediately
	•	Do NOT proceed to Wave I.4
	•	Await explicit approval

⸻

🔚 SUCCESS CRITERIA

Wave I.3 is successful only if:
	•	ParkHub is clearly exposed as a marketplace
	•	Users can discover operators and routes publicly
	•	No new logic was invented
	•	All gaps are explicitly documented
	•	Booking still happens only through existing flows
