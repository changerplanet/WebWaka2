🧪 PHASE D4 — ROLE-BY-ROLE UX VALIDATION MANDATE

Scope

Perform a manual, authenticated, role-by-role UX validation of the WebWaka platform using the already-seeded Demo Partner environment.

This phase is VALIDATION ONLY.
⚠️ NO code changes, NO schema changes, NO data seeding, NO configuration edits.

⸻

🎯 Objectives
	1.	Verify that each role sees exactly what it should see — nothing more, nothing less.
	2.	Confirm UI navigation, dashboards, and workflows align with role permissions.
	3.	Identify any UX or authorization gaps (UI or API).
	4.	Produce a clear pass/fail matrix per role and per suite.

⸻

🔐 Authentication Rules
	•	Use real login flows (magic link or password where applicable).
	•	Do not bypass authentication.
	•	Do not create new users.
	•	Use only existing demo users created under the WebWaka Demo Partner.

🧑‍💼 ROLES TO TEST

A. Partner-Level Roles (5)

Test one role at a time, fully log out between roles.

Role	Email
Partner Owner	demo.owner@webwaka.com
Partner Admin	demo.admin@webwaka.com
Partner Sales	demo.sales@webwaka.com
Partner Support	demo.support@webwaka.com
Partner Staff	demo.staff@webwaka.com

For EACH Partner Role, validate:
	•	Successful login
	•	Correct landing dashboard
	•	Visibility of:
	•	Client tenants
	•	Revenue/earnings widgets
	•	Staff & settings access
	•	Proper restriction of:
	•	Earnings
	•	Admin actions
	•	Cross-client access (for Staff)
	•	Attempt access to restricted pages and confirm blocking

B. Tenant-Level Roles (Per Suite)

Validate at least Admin + Staff + End User (where applicable) for each suite below.

For each suite:

Validate per role:
	•	Dashboard visibility

	•	Restricted actions are blocked (UI + API)
	•	No empty dashboards where data exists

🔍 WHAT TO EXPLICITLY CHECK

UI-Level

	•	Missing redirects to login
	•	Menu items visible but unusable
	•	Blank widgets where data exists

API-Level (Observed via UI)
	•	Unauthorized API calls returning data
	•	Silent failures instead of 401/403
	•	Inconsistent behavior between UI and backend
