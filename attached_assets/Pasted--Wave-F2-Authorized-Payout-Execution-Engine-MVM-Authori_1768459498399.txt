🔓 WAVE F2 — OFFICIALLY UNLOCKED

Wave: F2
Scope: Multi-Vendor Marketplace — Payout Execution Engine
Priority Band: 🟠 Priority Band 1 (Revenue & Trust Enabler)
Status: 🟢 APPROVED TO START

This wave is now cleared to proceed under the same governance, safety, and stop rules that have been enforced successfully across all prior waves.

⸻

🎯 WAVE F2 OBJECTIVE (RECONFIRMED)

Implement a Nigeria-realistic, trust-safe payout execution system that:
	•	Enables vendors to actually get paid
	•	Supports daily / weekly / on-demand payout cycles
	•	Works for formal and informal vendors
	•	Is tenant-scoped, partner-controlled, vendor-visible
	•	Is manual-triggered first (no automation unless later approved)
	•	Integrates cleanly with:
	•	Vendor Registration ✅
	•	Order Splitting Engine ✅
	•	Payout Visibility APIs (Wave 2.3) ✅
	•	Payment Transactions (Paystack, Bank Transfer, COD) ✅

⸻

🔒 GOVERNANCE RULES (STILL IN FORCE)

The following constraints remain binding:
	•	❌ No background jobs
	•	❌ No automatic payouts
	•	❌ No cron / schedulers
	•	❌ No auto-settlement
	•	❌ No revenue splitting beyond already-approved commission logic
	•	❌ No vendor-initiated payouts
	•	❌ No cross-tenant access

All payouts must be:
	•	Explicitly triggered by Partner / Tenant Admin
	•	Auditable
	•	Reversible (where possible)
	•	Clearly labeled demo vs live

🧱 EXPECTED WAVE F2 DELIVERABLES

At completion, Wave F2 must produce:

1. Payout Execution Model
	•	Payout batches
	•	Linked sub-orders
	•	Net amount after commission
	•	Status lifecycle:
	•	PENDING → APPROVED → PROCESSING → PAID / FAILED

2. Payout Execution APIs
	•	Partner-triggered payout creation
	•	Vendor-scoped payout views
	•	Clear separation:
	•	Visibility ≠ execution

3. Nigeria-First Payout Logic
	•	Daily / weekly payout grouping
	•	Minimum payout thresholds
	•	Bank transfer focus
	•	COD settlement support
	•	Partial payout handling

4. Security & Audit
	•	Session-derived vendorId (no spoofing)
	•	Immutable payout logs
	•	Who approved, who executed, when
	•	Demo-safe behavior

	1.	Wave F2 Completion Report
	2.	Explicit list of:
	•	Models created
	•	APIs created
	•	Status lifecycles
	•	Demo vs live behavior
	3.	Explicit confirmations:
	•	❌ No automation
