WebWaka POS — Full Real-World Validation Review

Access

You have full GitHub access to the WebWaka repository and can run the application locally.
You are expected to run, test, break, and stress the POS like a real Nigerian merchant would.

⸻

🎯 OBJECTIVE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Conduct a deep, end-to-end, real-world POS validation audit of WebWaka’s POS system to determine:
	1.	What actually works
	2.	What breaks under real usage
	3.	What feels confusing, slow, unsafe, or unrealistic
	4.	What is missing compared to real Nigerian retail behavior
	5.	What is implemented but unusable or incomplete
	6.	What should be fixed, enhanced, or added next

This is NOT a code-only review.
This is a product, UX, operations, and behavior audit.

⸻

🧠 REQUIRED DISCIPLINE (VERY IMPORTANT)

You MUST follow these rules:
	1.	No assumptions
	•	If you cannot find it in code or in the running app, it does not exist.
	2.	Run the POS
	•	Desktop browser
	•	Mobile browser
	•	Tablet size (landscape)
	3.	Simulate real Nigerian usage
	•	Poor internet
	•	Offline → online transitions
	•	Shared devices
	•	Cash + transfer heavy usage
	4.	Document before fixing
	•	First report everything
	•	Only then recommend fixes/enhancements
	5.	Be brutally honest
	•	If something is confusing, say it
	•	If something feels unrealistic, say it
	•	If something will cause merchant mistakes, flag it

🔍 SCOPE OF REVIEW

1️⃣ POS FUNCTIONAL TESTING (HANDS-ON)

You must execute and validate:
	•	Start-of-day flow
	•	Open shift
	•	Location selection
	•	Register assignment
	•	Cash float entry
	•	Sales (cash, transfer, offline)
	•	Discounts
	•	Voids
	•	Refunds (if any)
	•	End-of-day flow
	•	Z-Report
	•	Cash reconciliation
	•	Supervisor approvals
	•	Daily reconciliation
	•	Inventory adjustments
	•	Cash drawer transfers
	•	Offline sales → sync
	•	Duplicate prevention
	•	Error handling

For each flow, document:
	•	Works as expected
	•	Confusing
	•	Broken
	•	Missing guardrails
	•	Dangerous for real merchants

⸻

2️⃣ USER EXPERIENCE (REAL PEOPLE)

Evaluate the POS as if used by:
	•	A cashier with little tech knowledge
	•	A busy shop owner
	•	A supervisor overseeing staff
	•	A merchant during peak hours

Specifically assess:
	•	Number of taps/clicks
	•	Error clarity
	•	Feedback timing
	•	Mobile usability
	•	Touch target sizes
	•	Fat-finger risks
	•	Accidental destructive actions
	•	Supervisor override clarity

Flag anything that would:
	•	Cause wrong sales
	•	Cause cash loss
	•	Cause staff confusion
	•	Slow down checkout

⸻

3️⃣ OFFLINE-FIRST & NETWORK REALITY

Test and document:
	•	Full offline sale flow
	•	App reload while offline
	•	Browser refresh mid-sale
	•	Power loss simulation (close tab)
	•	Offline → online sync
	•	Partial sync failures
	•	Duplicate sale risks
	•	Conflict resolution UX (or lack of it)

Explicitly state:
	•	What the cashier sees
	•	What data is at risk
	•	Whether recovery is obvious or hidden

⸻

4️⃣ NIGERIA-FIRST REALITY CHECK

Compare the POS against actual Nigerian retail behavior:
	•	Bank transfers with screenshots
	•	Verbal confirmations
	•	Trusted customer credit
	•	Partial payments
	•	Change shortages
	•	Rounding realities
	•	WhatsApp reliance
	•	Shared devices & logins
	•	End-of-day cash balancing stress

Document:
	•	What WebWaka models correctly
	•	What it partially models
	•	What it completely ignores

⸻

5️⃣ SECURITY & ABUSE SCENARIOS

Test for:
	•	Privilege abuse
	•	Supervisor bypass
	•	Cashier doing manager actions
	•	Self-approval attempts
	•	Race conditions
	•	Re-submission of sales
	•	URL-based access to restricted views

Flag any scenario where:
	•	Money can be misrepresented
	•	Staff can cheat
	•	Audits can be disputed

⸻

6️⃣ PERFORMANCE & STABILITY

Observe and document:
	•	Slow screens
	•	Laggy modals
	•	Re-renders
	•	UI freezes
	•	Memory growth during long sessions
	•	localStorage / IndexedDB behavior

⸻

📊 REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

	•	Biggest risks if deployed now

⸻

🧪 SECTION B — TEST MATRIX

	•	Notes

⸻

⸻

🚦 SECTION H — GO / NO-GO ASSESSMENT

Would you personally recommend:
	•	Pilot rollout

	•	Do not deploy yet

Explain why.

⸻

⛔ IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
	•	Do NOT implement fixes yet
	•	Do NOT refactor code
	•	Do NOT skip UX issues because “it works technically”
	•	This is truth discovery, not defense

⸻

🧱 SUCCESS CRITERIA

This review should make it impossible for leadership to say:

“We didn’t know this would happen in real usage.”
