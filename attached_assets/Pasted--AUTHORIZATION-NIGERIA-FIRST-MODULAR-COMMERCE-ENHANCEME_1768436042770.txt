🔒 AUTHORIZATION — NIGERIA-FIRST MODULAR COMMERCE ENHANCEMENT REVIEW

POS • Single Vendor Marketplace (SVM) • Multi-Vendor Marketplace (MVM) • ParkHub

⸻

CONTEXT

You are reviewing an already-implemented, production-ready multi-tenant SaaS platform (WebWaka).

The platform already includes:
	•	POS
	•	Single Vendor Marketplace (SVM)
	•	Multi-Vendor Marketplace (MVM)
	•	ParkHub

The system is stable, demo-ready, and deployed with real tenants and real data.

⚠️ This task is DESIGN REVIEW ONLY.
❌ No bug fixes
❌ No code
❌ No schema changes
❌ No API changes

⸻

🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Carry out a deep, Nigeria-contextual enhancement review of:
	1.	POS
	2.	Single Vendor Marketplace (SVM)
	3.	Multi-Vendor Marketplace (MVM)
	4.	ParkHub

Your goal is to propose enhancements that make these modules deeply useful in Nigeria, factoring in:
	•	Mobile-first usage
	•	Offline-first operation
	•	PWA-first experience
	•	Low bandwidth
	•	Power and connectivity instability
	•	Informal and semi-formal business realities

⸻

🔑 CORE NON-NEGOTIABLE DESIGN AXIS

MODULAR COMMERCE + VENDOR-CONTROLLED PRODUCT SYNC

This is the most important requirement and must be treated as a first-class architectural concern, not an afterthought.

⸻

🔌 MODULAR SUBSCRIPTION MODEL (MANDATORY)

A vendor may subscribe to ANY combination of the following, independently:
	•	POS only
	•	SVM only
	•	MVM only
	•	POS + SVM
	•	POS + MVM
	•	SVM + MVM
	•	POS + SVM + MVM

You must assume ALL combinations are valid and common.

❗ No module may assume the existence of another module.

⸻

🔄 VENDOR-CONTROLLED PRODUCT SYNC (MANDATORY)

Vendors must be able to explicitly choose:
	•	Which products exist only in POS
	•	Which products appear in SVM (their own online store)
	•	Which products are exposed to MVM (resellers / marketplace)
	•	Which products sync inventory across:
	•	POS ↔ SVM
	•	POS ↔ MVM
	•	SVM ↔ MVM
	•	POS ↔ SVM ↔ MVM

This means:
	•	Product sync is opt-in, not automatic
	•	Inventory sync is per-product and per-channel
	•	Pricing may diverge by channel
	•	Availability may diverge by channel

⸻

🧠 CRITICAL SCENARIOS YOU MUST DESIGN FOR

You must explicitly analyze and propose designs for scenarios such as:
	•	Vendor uses SVM only (no POS, no MVM)
	•	Vendor uses POS + SVM, but disables MVM
	•	Vendor uses POS + MVM, but no SVM
	•	Vendor uses SVM + MVM, no physical POS
	•	Vendor disables one channel temporarily
	•	Vendor sells offline on POS while:
	•	SVM is live
	•	MVM orders are coming in
	•	Conflicting stock updates across channels
	•	Offline sales reconciliation when device reconnects

⸻

📐 REQUIRED ANALYSIS DIMENSIONS (MANDATORY)

For EACH module (POS, SVM, MVM, ParkHub), you MUST cover:

⸻

1️⃣ CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
	•	What the module already does well
	•	Nigerian business types it already fits
	•	Hidden assumptions (desktop, stable internet, single channel)

⸻

2️⃣ MODULAR SUBSCRIPTION & PRODUCT SYNC BEHAVIOR

(THIS SECTION IS REQUIRED FOR EVERY MODULE)

Explicitly analyze:
	•	Product ownership (who owns the master?)
	•	Channel-level product visibility controls
	•	Inventory synchronization rules
	•	Pricing divergence rules
	•	Offline conflict resolution strategies
	•	Channel enable / disable lifecycle behavior
	•	What breaks today and why

⸻

3️⃣ NIGERIA-SPECIFIC REALITY GAPS

Identify gaps related to:
	•	Power outages
	•	Shared devices
	•	Cash-first workflows
	•	Trust & fraud prevention
	•	Poor GPS accuracy
	•	Market levies & informal fees
	•	Low digital literacy

⸻

4️⃣ MOBILE-FIRST UX ENHANCEMENTS

Propose:
	•	Card-based layouts instead of tables
	•	Large tap targets (≥44px)
	•	Camera-first workflows (QR, receipts, proof)
	•	One-hand usage patterns
	•	Minimal typing flows

⸻

5️⃣ OFFLINE-FIRST DESIGN (DESIGN ONLY)

Propose:
	•	What works fully offline
	•	What queues for later sync
	•	How users see sync status
	•	How conflicts are resolved in UX
	•	How trust is maintained offline

⸻

6️⃣ PWA-FIRST STRATEGY

Cover:
	•	Installability improvements
	•	Home-screen-centric usage
	•	Background sync readiness
	•	Storage constraints on low-end Android phones
	•	Clear offline indicators

⸻

7️⃣ BUSINESS & REVENUE IMPACT

For every enhancement:
	•	Who benefits (vendor, partner, customer)
	•	Revenue impact
	•	Adoption friction
	•	Competitive advantage in Nigeria/Africa

⸻

⸻

🛑 HARD STOP RULE

After submitting the report:
	•	STOP
	•	Do not implement anything
	•	Wait for explicit approval per enhancement group

⸻

🎯 EXPECTED DEPTH & MINDSET

Think like:
	•	A market trader with poor network
	•	A roadside vendor with one phone
	•	A supermarket with POS + online sales
	•	A reseller on a marketplace
	•	A park operator managing daily cash flow

Avoid Silicon Valley assumptions.
Design for Nigeria first, Africa second, global later.
