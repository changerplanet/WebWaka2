Excellent — this is a clean, compliant, and well-executed Phase E2.1.
I’m formally acknowledging completion and moving us forward in the agreed sequence.

⸻

✅ PHASE E2.1 — ACCEPTED & CLOSED

Status: ✔️ Approved
Architecture: ✔️ Sound
Scope compliance: ✔️ 100%
Constraint adherence: ✔️ No violations

What you delivered aligns perfectly with intent:
