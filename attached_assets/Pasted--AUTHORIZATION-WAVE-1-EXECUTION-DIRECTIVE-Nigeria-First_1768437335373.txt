🔓 AUTHORIZATION — WAVE 1 EXECUTION DIRECTIVE

Nigeria-First Modular Commerce Enhancement

STATUS
	•	Strategy & Design: ✅ Approved
	•	Execution Mode: Sequential, Approval-Gated
	•	Current Wave: 🟥 WAVE 1 — FOUNDATIONAL ARCHITECTURE
	•	All other waves: 🔒 LOCKED

⸻

🎯 WAVE 1 OBJECTIVE (DO NOT EXPAND)

Make modular, multi-channel commerce technically possible across:
	•	POS
	•	Single Vendor Marketplace (SVM)
	•	Multi-Vendor Marketplace (MVM)
	•	ParkHub

This wave establishes core architecture only. No polish, no integrations beyond what’s listed.

⸻

✅ WAVE 1 SCOPE — MUST IMPLEMENT ALL

1️⃣ Product Channel Configuration System (PLATFORM-WIDE)

Implement a vendor-controlled, channel-aware product system that allows:
	•	Channel visibility: POS / SVM / MVM (independently)
	•	Channel-specific pricing overrides
	•	Inventory modes:
	•	SHARED
	•	ALLOCATED
	•	UNLIMITED
	•	Sync rules per channel (price + inventory)
	•	Channel lifecycle:
	•	INACTIVE → ACTIVE → PAUSED → ACTIVE
	•	Vendor subscription awareness:
	•	POS only
	•	SVM only
	•	MVM only
	•	Any combination of the three

⚠️ Core product remains master. Channel config must not duplicate product.

⸻

2️⃣ POS Offline Transaction Queue (CRITICAL)

Implement a true offline-first POS layer:
	•	IndexedDB persistence
	•	Offline sale queue
	•	Sync engine on reconnect
	•	Conflict detection (oversell, price mismatch)
	•	Manual conflict resolution UI
	•	Clear offline/online visual indicator

⸻

3️⃣ Vendor Registration API (MVM)

Implement real backend vendor onboarding:
	•	Phone-first registration
	•	Optional BVN / CAC
	•	Vendor lifecycle states
	•	Admin approval flow
	•	Tenant + partner scoping enforced

❌ No payouts yet
❌ No WhatsApp/SMS yet

⸻

4️⃣ Order Splitting Engine (MVM)

Implement actual order splitting:
	•	Parent marketplace order
	•	Vendor-specific sub-orders
	•	Isolated fulfillment
	•	Unified customer view
	•	Inventory deduction aligned with channel rules

⸻

5️⃣ ParkHub Walk-Up POS Interface

Implement agent-first, offline-first ticket sales:
	•	≤3 tap ticket sale
	•	Route/destination search
	•	Seat deduction per trip
	•	Receipt support
	•	Cash + transfer toggle

⸻

6️⃣ Dynamic Departure Model (ParkHub)

Implement Nigerian-realistic trip logic:
	•	“Leaves when full” support
	•	Capacity-based departure
	•	Trip auto-close on threshold
	•	Status lifecycle enforcement

⸻

7️⃣ Cash Rounding Module (POS)

Implement NGN-realistic rounding:
	•	₦5 / ₦10 / ₦50 options
	•	Display rounding on receipt
	•	Audit trail for adjustments

⸻
