🚀 PHASE D7 — STRONG DEMO HARDENING (ALL SUITES)

Phase Objective

Upgrade WebWaka from L3 (Sales Demo Ready) to L4 (Strong, Self-Sufficient Demo Across ALL Suites) by ensuring every suite can independently support a confident sales demo without disclaimers, empty states, or workaround explanations.

This phase is data- and UX-hardening only.

⸻

🔒 HARD CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

DO NOT:
	•	Add new product features
	•	Change business logic
	•	Introduce new schemas unless explicitly approved
	•	Alter production deployment configuration
	•	Modify authentication or authorization logic
	•	Refactor unrelated code
	•	Add performance optimizations

ALLOWED:
	•	Add or extend demo seed data

⸻

📌 PHASE D7 STRUCTURE (EXECUTE IN ORDER)

⸻

🔹 Phase D7.1 — Strong Demo Definition Lock (READ-ONLY)

Goal

Define what “strong demoable” means for every suite, so execution is objective and verifiable.

Deliverable

STRONG_DEMO_DEFINITION_MATRIX.md

For each suite, document:
	•	Primary demo persona
	•	Secondary persona (if any)
	•	1–2 core workflows
	•	Screens that MUST show data
	•	Minimum data depth required

🚫 No code changes in this step.

⸻

🔹 Phase D7.2 — Targeted Demo Data Reinforcement

Goal

Upgrade weak or partial suites by adding realistic, narrative demo data so workflows are complete and dashboards are populated.

Scope by Suite

Suite	Required Reinforcement
Commerce (Online Store)	Orders, carts, checkout trail
Marketplace (MVM)	Vendor activity, payouts
Education	Multi-term history, grades
Health	Encounters, prescriptions, patient history
Hospitality	Reservation → stay lifecycle
Civic	Case lifecycle progression
Logistics	Delivery jobs + assignments
Church	Events, attendance, giving
Political	Campaign activity, donations
Real Estate	Lease lifecycle, rent payments

Rules
	•	Use existing models only
	•	All data MUST belong to Demo Partner tenants
	•	Record counts must stay reasonable (demo realism > volume)

⸻

🔹 Phase D7.3 — UX Confidence Pass (Read-Only / Light UI)

Goal

Remove demo friction and embarrassment during sales walkthroughs.

Allowed adjustments:
	•	Improve empty-state messages
	•	Replace misleading “None” / “0” with clearer copy
	•	Add “Sample Data” / “Demo Mode” badges where appropriate
	•	Ensure dashboards never appear broken or unfinished

🚫 No navigation or feature changes.

⸻

🔹 Phase D7.4 — Full Sales Re-Validation (READ-ONLY)

Goal

Re-run Phase D6 with ALL suites expected to score 🟢 Strong Demo.

Deliverable

PHASE_D7_FINAL_SALES_DEMO_REPORT.md

Must include:
	•	Per-suite demo readiness verdict
	•	Demo risks (if any)
	•	Confirmation that no disclaimers are required

⸻

✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA (L4 SIGN-OFF)

Phase D7 is successful when:
	•	✅ Every suite supports at least one full, believable workflow
	•	✅ No empty dashboards for demo personas
	•	✅ All suites can be demoed as a primary vertical
	•	✅ Sales walkthrough requires no apologies or explanations
	•	✅ Data is realistic, localized, and role-aware

⸻

🧠 EXECUTION AUTHORITY
	•	Execution Agent: Replit Agent
	•	Execution Mode: Continuous, sequential (do not pause between D7.1 → D7.4)
	•	Stop Conditions:
	•	Unexpected schema gap
	•	Data integrity violation
	•	Authorization regression

⸻
