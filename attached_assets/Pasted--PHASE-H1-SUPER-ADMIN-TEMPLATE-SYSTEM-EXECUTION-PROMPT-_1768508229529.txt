🚀 PHASE H1 — SUPER ADMIN TEMPLATE SYSTEM (EXECUTION PROMPT)

CONTEXT

You are working on WebWaka, a multi-tenant, Nigeria-first SaaS platform with:
	•	Sites & Funnels module
	•	Block-based visual page builder (already implemented)
	•	Strong governance rules (no automation, no background jobs unless approved)
	•	Partner-first model (WebWaka does NOT sell directly to end users)

We are now implementing Phase H1:
👉 Super Admin–only Template System for Sites & Funnels.

This phase is FOUNDATIONAL and must be done with extreme care.

⸻

🎯 PHASE H1 OBJECTIVE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Prepare WebWaka to accept, manage, and deploy templates that are:
	•	✅ Created ONLY by Super Admin
	•	✅ Used (cloned) by Partners
	•	❌ NOT created, edited, or uploaded by Partners
	•	❌ NOT sold or monetized
	•	❌ NOT marketplace-enabled

Templates will be used to quickly create:
	•	Websites
	•	Funnels
for Partners and their client tenants.

⸻

🔐 GOVERNANCE RULES (STRICT)

TEMPLATE CREATION
	•	ONLY SUPER_ADMIN can:
	•	Create templates
	•	Upload templates
	•	Publish templates
	•	Deprecate templates
	•	Templates are read-only blueprints

TEMPLATE USAGE
	•	Partners can:
	•	View templates
	•	Preview templates
	•	Clone templates
	•	Apply templates to tenants
	•	Partners CANNOT:
	•	Modify original templates
	•	Upload templates
	•	Publish templates
	•	Sell templates

LOVABLE
	•	Lovable is NOT integrated
	•	Lovable output is assumed to be manually exported
	•	WebWaka only needs to accept controlled template input
	•	NO Lovable API calls
	•	NO automation

⸻

🚫 EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE (DO NOT IMPLEMENT)
	•	❌ Partner template uploads
	•	❌ Template marketplace
	•	❌ Template payments
	•	❌ Revenue sharing
	•	❌ White-label resale
	•	❌ Drag-and-drop builder changes
	•	❌ AI generation
	•	❌ Automations
	•	❌ Notifications
	•	❌ Background jobs
	•	❌ Public template APIs

⸻

🧱 REQUIRED SYSTEMS TO BUILD

1️⃣ TEMPLATE CORE (MANDATORY)

Implement a Template Engine that supports:

Template Types
	•	SITE_TEMPLATE
	•	FUNNEL_TEMPLATE

Template Manifest (Versioned)
Each template MUST have:
	•	id
	•	name
	•	description
	•	templateType (site | funnel)
	•	industry/category
	•	supportedPages or steps
	•	blockStructure (schema-driven)
	•	version
	•	status: DRAFT | PUBLISHED | DEPRECATED
	•	isDemo
	•	createdBy (SUPER_ADMIN only)
	•	createdAt / updatedAt

Templates must be immutable once published.

⸻

2️⃣ TEMPLATE STORAGE & ACCESS

You may choose:
	•	Database-backed templates
	•	OR file-backed templates with DB registry

But:
	•	Template source is protected
	•	Clones reference templateId + version
	•	Template updates MUST NOT break existing clones

⸻

3️⃣ TEMPLATE CLONING MECHANISM

When a Partner clones a template:
	•	A new Site or Funnel instance is created
	•	Content is copied
	•	Tokens are resolved:
	•	{{tenant.name}}
	•	{{brand.primaryColor}}
	•	{{contact.phone}}
	•	Original template remains untouched

⸻

4️⃣ SUPER ADMIN CONTROLS (REQUIRED)

Implement Super Admin capabilities:
	•	Create template (internal only)
	•	Upload template definition
	•	Validate template schema
	•	Publish / unpublish templates
	•	Mark template as:
	•	Partner-visible
	•	Demo-only
	•	Deprecate templates safely

Access must be enforced via:
	•	SUPER_ADMIN role only
	•	Server-side authorization

⸻

5️⃣ PARTNER EXPERIENCE (READ-ONLY)

Partners should be able to:
	•	Browse template catalog
	•	Filter by:
	•	Industry
	•	Template type
	•	Preview template
	•	Clone template
	•	Apply template to:
	•	New tenant
	•	Existing tenant site/funnel

No edit access to originals.

⸻

🧪 DEMO SAFETY
	•	Templates can be flagged isDemo
	•	Demo templates:
	•	Clearly labeled
	•	Allowed in demo tenants
	•	Optional visibility in production

⸻

🧩 INTEGRATION CONSTRAINTS

You MUST integrate with:
	•	Existing Sites & Funnels module
	•	Existing Page Builder blocks
	•	Existing Partner / Tenant scoping

You MUST NOT:
	•	Modify payment systems
	•	Modify auth flows
	•	Modify inventory, commerce, or POS logic

⸻

🛑 STOP CONDITIONS (MANDATORY)

When Phase H1 is complete, you MUST:
	1.	Produce a PHASE_H1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
	2.	Explicitly list:
	•	Models created
	•	APIs created
	•	Admin-only actions
	•	Partner-allowed actions
	•	Example template manifest
	3.	Explicitly confirm:
	•	❌ No partner uploads
	•	❌ No marketplace
	•	❌ No payments
	•	❌ No automations
	4.	STOP and WAIT for approval

DO NOT proceed to:
	•	Partner template creation
	•	Template marketplace
	•	White-label monetization

⸻

🧠 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (IMPORTANT)

This phase exists to:
	•	Maintain quality
	•	Prevent ecosystem chaos
	•	Support Nigerian partners
	•	Enable fast demos
	•	Lay groundwork for future marketplace (NOT NOW)

Think governance-first, not growth-at-all-costs.
