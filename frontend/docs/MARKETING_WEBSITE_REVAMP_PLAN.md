# WebWaka Marketing Website Revamp Plan

**Document Type:** Strategic Marketing Website Plan  
**Date:** January 14, 2026  
**Status:** STRATEGY PHASE - AWAITING APPROVAL  
**Author:** Replit Agent (Strategy Review)  

---

## Executive Summary

This plan reconstructs the WebWaka marketing website to accurately represent the platform's current state:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Implemented Suites** | 20+ |
| **Database Tables** | 300+ |
| **API Route Modules** | 150+ |
| **Service Files** | 200+ |
| **Demo Tenants** | 16 |
| **Partner Roles** | 5 types |
| **Sites & Funnels** | Full capability |

### Critical Positioning Shift

The current marketing website is **outdated**. The revamp must reflect:

1. **Partner-First Model**: WebWaka never sells directly to end users
2. **20+ Vertical Suites**: Not just 7 - includes Church, Political, Real Estate, etc.
3. **Sites & Funnels**: GoHighLevel-class capability for Partners
4. **Nigerian Context**: Lagos-first, Naira-native, mobile-first
5. **Governance-First**: Commerce Boundary, Audit-First, v2-FREEZE discipline

## DELIVERABLE 3: PARTNER-FOCUSED MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

### 3.1 Core Messaging Pillars

| Pillar | Message | Evidence |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Build Your SaaS Business** | Partners don't just resell - they build businesses on WebWaka | White-label, own pricing, own clients |
| **20+ Ready Verticals** | Don't build from scratch - configure and deploy | All suites implemented with APIs, schemas, services |
| **Nigeria-Native** | Built for how Nigerians do business | Naira, bank transfers, mobile money, Lagos context |
| **Recurring Revenue** | Monthly fees from your clients = predictable income | Partner sets pricing, WebWaka provides infrastructure |
| **Sites & Funnels** | Compete with GoHighLevel in Nigeria | Full website/funnel builder for your clients |

### 3.2 Key Differentiators

| vs Competitor | WebWaka Advantage |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **vs GoHighLevel** | Nigeria-native, Naira pricing, local payment methods, no USD billing |
| **vs Odoo** | Partner-first (you own clients), no per-user licensing complexity |
| **vs Zoho** | Vertical-specific (not generic), Nigerian context built-in |
| **vs Custom Dev** | Already built (20+ suites), no 6-month wait, no dev team needed |
| **vs Flutterwave/Paystack** | Complete platform (not just payments), full business operations |

### 3.3 Nigeria/Africa-Specific Positioning

| Aspect | Positioning |
|--------|-------------|
| **Currency** | Naira-native, no currency conversion headaches |
| **Payments** | Bank transfer, USSD, mobile money, POS integration |
| **Mobile-First** | Designed for smartphone-primary users |
| **Offline-Ready** | Works in low-connectivity areas |
| **Local Context** | Nigerian business names, Lagos addresses, local examples |
| **Language** | Professional but accessible English, no jargon |

### 3.4 Language Tone Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Build your platform business" | "Subscribe to our SaaS" |
| "Deploy in days, not months" | "Quick and easy setup" |
| "Your clients, your pricing, your brand" | "White-label solution" |
| "Nigerian-built for Nigerian business" | "Localized for Africa" |
| "20+ vertical suites ready to deploy" | "Customizable platform" |
| "Partner with us to serve your market" | "Sign up today" |

## DELIVERABLE 4: MOBILE-FIRST NAVIGATION STRATEGY

### 4.1 Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Thumb-Friendly** | Bottom navigation bar, large tap targets (48px minimum) |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Suite categories collapse/expand, don't show all 20+ at once |
| **Content-First** | Hero sections load first, images lazy-load |
| **Bandwidth-Conscious** | < 500KB initial load, WebP images, minimal JavaScript |
| **WhatsApp-First CTAs** | "Chat with us on WhatsApp" prominently placed |

### 4.2 Mobile Navigation Hierarchy
