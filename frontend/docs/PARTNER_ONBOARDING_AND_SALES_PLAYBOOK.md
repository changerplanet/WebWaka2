## 1. Purpose of This Playbook

This playbook exists to help Partners:

- **Understand** what WebWaka really is
- **Know** what they are selling (and what they are not)
- **Confidently** onboard clients
- **Package, price, and expand** accounts
- **Avoid** selling confusion or scope creep
- **Build** a long-term SaaS business, not one-off projects

---

## 2. The Core Message (Non-Negotiable)

> **WebWaka is not an app you resell.**
> **WebWaka is the infrastructure you build your own platforms on.**

**Partners are not agents.**
**Partners are platform operators.**

This distinction is fundamental. You are not selling someone else's product—you are building your own SaaS business on WebWaka's infrastructure.

---

## 3. Who This Is For / Not For

### Eligible Partner Types

| Partner Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Digital Agencies | Full-service digital transformation providers |
| IT Consultants | Technology advisors and implementers |
| Field Agents & MSME Enablers | On-the-ground business support specialists |
| NGOs & Development Organizations | Capacity-building and empowerment organizations |
| Government System Integrators | Public sector technology partners |
| Industry Associations | Trade bodies and cooperative groups |
| Youth-Led Tech Businesses | Emerging technology entrepreneurs |

### Who This Is NOT For

- End users looking for a ready-made app
- Individual shop owners (unless becoming Partners)
- Freelancers looking for one-off gigs

---

## 4. Partner Roles & Powers

### As a WebWaka Partner, You Can:

✅ Create client organizations
✅ Launch multiple platforms per client
✅ Brand each platform under your own name
✅ Set your own pricing
✅ Bill your clients directly
✅ Earn recurring revenue
✅ Expand accounts without migrations

### WebWaka's Role:

- Powers the infrastructure
- Bills you wholesale
- **Never competes with you**
- **Never takes your clients**

> **Key Rule:** Your clients are YOUR clients. WebWaka is the infrastructure provider—nothing more.

---

## 5. What You Are Selling (And Not Selling)

### You ARE Selling:

| What You Sell | What This Means |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Digital Transformation | Helping organizations move from manual to digital operations |
| Configured Platforms | Tailored solutions built on WebWaka infrastructure |
| Ongoing Support & Growth | Long-term partnership, not a one-time sale |

### You Are NOT Selling:

- A single app
- A one-time website
- A boxed product

> **Partner Tip:** Frame your offering as "your platform powered by enterprise infrastructure"—not "a WebWaka subscription."

---

## 6. How to Sell WebWaka (Step-by-Step Sales Flow)

### STEP 1 — Identify the Client's Core Problem

**Ask:**
- What are you currently doing manually?
- Where are you losing time or money?
- Who needs access to information?
- Do you operate in more than one area?

**Avoid:** Talking about features first. Lead with their pain, not your product.

---

### STEP 2 — Choose the FIRST Platform (Not Everything)

**Examples:**
- POS for a retail business
- Marketplace for a market association
- School system for an institution
- Civic platform for an organization

> **Key Rule:** Start with one platform. Expand later.

---

### STEP 3 — Explain Expansion (This Is the Magic)

**Use this line:**

> "We'll start with one platform. As you grow, we can add more platforms under the same system—without rebuilding anything."

**This sets up:**
- Upsells
- Long-term contracts
- Trust

---

### STEP 4 — Package Your Offer

Partners decide:
- Setup fee
- Monthly subscription
- Support tier
- Customization scope

> **Key Rule:** WebWaka does NOT dictate retail pricing. You control your margins.

---

## 7. Partner-Led Onboarding Process

| Step | Action | Who Does It |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Create Client Organization | Partner |
| 2 | Create first Platform Instance | Partner |
| 3 | Assign domain & branding | Partner |
| 4 | Activate required capabilities | Partner |
| 5 | Invite client admins/users | Partner |
| 6 | Train client team | Partner |

> **What This Means in Practice:** The client never touches WebWaka directly. You are their provider.

---

## 8. Multi-Platform Selling Explained

### Example: One Client, Three Platforms

| Platform | Type | Pricing |
|----------|------|---------|
| Retail POS | Commerce | Paid separately |
| Online Store | Marketplace | Paid separately |
| Accounting & Reporting | Back-office | Included or bundled |

### Key Points:

- Each platform can be **branded differently**
- Each platform can be **priced differently**
- Each platform can **grow independently**

> **Partner Tip:** This is how Partners increase lifetime value. Don't sell one platform—sell a growth path.

---

## 9. How Partners Make Money

### Revenue Streams

| Revenue Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Setup & Onboarding Fees | One-time implementation charges |
| Monthly Subscriptions | Recurring platform fees (your pricing) |
| Platform Expansions | Adding new platforms to existing clients |
| Custom Integrations | Technical work beyond standard setup |
| Training & Support | Ongoing client enablement |
| White-Label Offerings | Fully branded solutions |

### Long-Term Advantage

> **Recurring revenue > One-off projects**

Build a portfolio of clients paying monthly, not a pipeline of projects that end.

---

## 10. Support & Responsibility Model

### Partner Handles:

- Client onboarding
- First-line support
- Configuration
- Training

### WebWaka Handles:

- Platform uptime
- Security
- Core updates
- Infrastructure scaling

> **What This Means in Practice:** Clean separation. You own the client relationship; we own the technology.

---

## 11. Branding & White-Label Rules

### Clients See:

✅ Partner brand
✅ Partner domain
✅ Partner support contact

### Clients Do NOT See:

❌ WebWaka pricing
❌ WebWaka sales CTAs
❌ Other partners

> **Key Rule:** This protects your business. Your clients see YOU as the platform provider.

---

## 12. Common Objections & Clear Answers

| Objection | Answer |
|-----------|--------|
| "Can we start small?" | Yes. One platform. Expand later. |
| "What if we change direction?" | Add or remove platforms without migration. |
| "Is this only for commerce?" | No. Education, health, civic, logistics, and more. |
| "Who owns the data?" | Your client. Managed by you. |
| "What if we outgrow this?" | The infrastructure scales. You don't migrate. |

---

## 13. What Success Looks Like for a Partner

### Target Benchmarks:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Active Clients | 5–10 |
| Platforms per Client | 1–3 |
| Revenue Model | Monthly recurring |
| Local Reputation | Strong, trusted provider |
| Growth Pattern | Expansion without burnout |

Success is not about volume—it's about sustainable, recurring relationships.

---

## 14. Partner Golden Rules

1. **Don't oversell features** — Solve problems, don't demo capabilities
2. **Start with one platform** — Expand is always possible
3. **Price for sustainability** — Your business needs margins
4. **Educate clients early** — Set expectations from day one
5. **Think in years, not projects** — Build recurring revenue

---

## 15. One-Line Partner Pitch

**Memorize this:**

> "We help organizations build and grow their own digital platforms—powered by WebWaka."

Use it in every conversation. It positions you as the builder, WebWaka as the infrastructure.
