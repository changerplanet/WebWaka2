## INTRODUCTION

### Why So Many Suites?

Nigerian businesses are diverse. A school operates differently from a clinic. A church has different needs than a logistics company. Generic software forces businesses to adapt. WebWaka adapts to businesses.

Each suite is purpose-built for its industry:
- Pre-configured workflows
- Industry-specific terminology
- Relevant reports and dashboards
- Nigerian regulatory awareness

**As a partner, you pick the suites that match your market and expertise.**
