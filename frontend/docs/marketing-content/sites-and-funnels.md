## SECTION 1: WHAT THIS MEANS FOR PARTNERS

### Heading
**Stop Trading Hours for Money**

### Body
Here's the old way:
- Client asks for a website
- You spend 2-4 weeks building it
- You charge a one-time fee
- Client needs changes, you do more work for free
- You move to the next project, start from zero

Here's the WebWaka way:
- Client asks for a website
- You clone an industry template
- You customize with their branding and content
- You deploy to their domain
- You charge setup + monthly maintenance
- AI helps generate content
- Analytics show you what's working
- Client succeeds, you get referrals

**This is how you build a sustainable business, not a freelancing hamster wheel.**

2. Tell the AI about the client's business
3. AI generates content options
4. You pick and customize
5. Done in minutes, not hours

**This is how you deliver 5 websites in the time it used to take to build one.**

## SECTION 5: SUITE INTEGRATION

### Heading
**Websites That Connect to Real Business Systems**

### Body
This is what separates WebWaka Sites & Funnels from Wix, Squarespace, or even GoHighLevel.

When you build a website on WebWaka, it can connect directly to any WebWaka suite:

| Site Type | Connected Suite | What Happens |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Clinic website | Health Suite | Appointment form creates patient record |
| School website | Education Suite | Inquiry form creates prospective student |
| Church website | Church Suite | First-time guest form creates member record |
| Hotel website | Hospitality Suite | Booking form creates reservation |
| E-commerce site | Commerce Suite | Products sync, orders flow through |

**The website isn't just a brochure. It's the front door to your client's entire operation.**

---

## SECTION 6: DOMAIN AND BRANDING

### Heading
**Your Client's Brand. Their Domain. Zero WebWaka Branding.**

### Body
Every site you build:
- Uses your client's custom domain
- Shows your client's logo and colors
- Has no WebWaka branding visible to end users
- SSL certificates handled automatically
- DNS verification built in

**Your clients never know WebWaka exists. They know they hired a great partner.**
