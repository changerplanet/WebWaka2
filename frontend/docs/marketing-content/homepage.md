## SECTION 1: THE PARTNER MODEL

### Heading
**You Build the Business. We Provide the Platform.**

### Body
WebWaka is not software you buy. It's infrastructure you build on.

We never sell directly to businesses. Instead, we partner with digital agencies, ICT vendors, consultants, and entrepreneurs who want to deliver complete business platforms to their clients.

You own the client relationship. You set the pricing. You provide the support. We give you 20+ ready-to-deploy industry suites, a website and funnel builder, and the infrastructure that makes it all work.

**Your clients see your brand. Not ours.**
