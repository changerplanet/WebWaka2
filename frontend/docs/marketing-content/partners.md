## SECTION 1: WHAT IS A WEBWAKA PARTNER?

### Heading
**We Don't Sell Software. We Enable Partners.**

### Body
WebWaka is different from other software platforms. We don't sell directly to businesses. We don't compete with our partners. We don't take your clients.

**A WebWaka Partner is a business owner who:**
- Finds and closes clients who need business software
- Configures WebWaka suites for those clients
- Sets their own pricing and keeps the margin
- Provides support and builds relationships
- Earns recurring revenue month after month

**WebWaka provides:**
- 20+ fully-built industry suites
- Sites & Funnels for building client websites
- Infrastructure, hosting, and security
- Training and certification
- Partner support and resources

**You are not a reseller. You are a platform operator.**

## SECTION 2: WHY THE PARTNER MODEL?

### Heading
**Better for Clients. Better for You. Better for Nigeria.**

### Why We Chose This Model

**For Clients**
Nigerian businesses don't want to deal with a software company in Lagos (or abroad). They want a partner who understands their local context, speaks their language, and answers their calls. That's you.

**For Partners**
Instead of building software from scratch or reselling someone else's product at thin margins, you operate a complete platform. You set the price. You own the relationship. You build real equity.

**For Nigeria**
This model creates jobs. Thousands of partners across Nigeria, each building a sustainable business, each employing support staff, each contributing to the digital economy.

**We could sell direct. We choose not to. This is intentional.**

## SECTION 4: REVENUE MODEL

### Heading
**How You Make Money**

### Revenue Streams

**Setup Fees**
Charge clients for initial configuration, data migration, and training. You set the price based on complexity and client size.

**Monthly Fees**
Charge clients a monthly subscription for access to their platform. You set the price. Typical range: ₦25,000 - ₦250,000/month depending on suite and business size.

**Sites & Funnels**
Build websites and funnels for clients. Charge setup fees plus monthly maintenance. This is pure margin.

**Add-On Services**
Offer consulting, training, customization, and support packages. Some partners charge for WhatsApp priority support.

### Example Math

| Scenario | Monthly Recurring |
|----------|-------------------|
| 10 small clients × ₦30,000 | ₦300,000/month |
| 20 clients × ₦50,000 | ₦1,000,000/month |
| 5 enterprise clients × ₦200,000 | ₦1,000,000/month |

**Plus setup fees, plus sites & funnels, plus add-on services.**

### What You Pay WebWaka
Partners pay WebWaka a platform fee based on usage. This is significantly less than what you charge clients. The margin is yours.

*Specific pricing discussed during partner onboarding.*

---

## SECTION 6: WHO THIS IS NOT FOR

### Heading
**Be Honest With Yourself**

### Not a Fit If:

**You want software for your own business**
We don't sell direct. If you just need software for your shop or clinic, ask a partner to help you—or become a partner yourself.

**You want to build custom software**
WebWaka is a platform, not a framework. You configure and deploy, you don't code.

**You're looking for a quick flip**
This is a business you build over time. It requires sales effort, client management, and persistence.

**You're not willing to learn**
Partners need to understand the platform well enough to configure it and train clients. We provide training, but you have to show up.

**You're outside Nigeria/Africa**
Our platform is built for Nigerian business context. Currency, payments, regulations, examples—all Nigerian. If you're serving other markets, this isn't the right fit.
