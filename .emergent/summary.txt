<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's goal is to build a production-grade, reusable SaaS Core with a Next.js App Router and PostgreSQL (Prisma), extended with independently subscribable modules (POS, SVM, MVM). The project follows a strict, phased roadmap. Having completed the UI, commerce backend, production hardening, and a full rebrand, the project has now entered its final phase: building a customer-facing marketing website.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
- Phase A: Product UI Implementation (COMPLETE)
- Phase B: Commerce Completeness (COMPLETE)
- Phase C: Production Readiness (COMPLETE)
- Phase D: Platform Identity & Branding (COMPLETE)
- Phase E: Customer-Facing Website (IN PROGRESS)

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
- A complete full-stack application, now named eMarketWaka, featuring a Next.js frontend and a PostgreSQL/Prisma backend.

- **Phase B (Commerce)**: The backend supports persistent SVM carts/orders and a ledger-based Core Wallet system for customers, vendors, and the platform.
- **Phase C (Production Readiness)**: A comprehensive Jest test suite (unit, integration, e2e) has been implemented. Basic performance/load testing scripts, rate limiting, audit logging, and a metrics endpoint have been added.
- **Phase D (Branding)**: The platform was successfully rebranded from SaaS Core to eMarketWaka, with all cosmetic UI and configuration changes applied.
- **Phase E (Marketing Website)**: The agent has initiated this phase by creating the file/folder structure for a new marketing website within the  project under . Placeholder pages for Home, Features, Solutions, Pricing, Partners, and About have been created, along with a dedicated layout.
